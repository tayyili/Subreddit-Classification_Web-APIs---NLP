Also when i change refresh rate or when I toggle Virtual Super Resolution or GPU scaling it does the flickering again.

Then it says its finishes installation then starts flickering then i need to restart properly. After that, it is fine unless the computer then sleeps after not being on for some time ( its a gaming laptop) and when usually a spacebar tap should turn it on it goes black screen again. Also when i change refresh rate or when I toggle Virtual Super Resolution or GPU scaling it does the flickering again. I searched this up and the solution was to uninstall dragon center and that doesn't do anything, even when i uninstall everything AMD Radeon software and re install. I've tried with both 21.4.1 and 21.5.1. I then decided to just do the windows update driver AMD display and I think that downloaded the original driver and software version that the laptop originally came with. \\n\\nI get stuttering even when uninstalling with ddu ,I think the windows update one it originally came with was 21.3.1 or 21.3.2 and there’s no issues what so ever no change in FPS no decrease in performance so do you think it would be fine for now? \\n\\nAMD Radeon software version:  [https://imgur.com/a/EJFgYPT]\\n\\nMy laptop is an MSI Bravo 15 with rx 5500m , ryzen 7 4th gen and 8gb ram.\\n\\nMany thanks,\"\n",
