R7 3700x on MSI B550 Tomahawk A7 BIOS and DDR4-3600C16 RAM.  XMP profile activated. HWiNFO reports it's operating in dual channel mode @ 1800 MHz.

I noticed a new feature in HWiNFO 7.06 that reports the DRAM Read and Write bandwidth.  During a video encode (x265), I noticed the read bandwidth is low vs. the peak speed of the RAM.  If I've done my math right, it's about 4.3% of the rated speed.  ""Current"" is way slower than ""maximum"" - &lt; 4 Gbps.

The write bandwidth is even slower. ""Maximum"" is 0.347 Gbps.

A Prime95 stress test got the maximum DRAM bandwidth up to 15 Gbps, but well short of rated.

I assume writing would be slower because of the DRAM refresh cycle.  But writing at 3.5% of the bandwidth of reading?  And reading at 4.3% of the peak rated speed?

* Bug in HWiNFO?
* Bug in the MSI A7 BIOS?
* Defective RAM/MB/Processor? (Some time ago I did a Prime95 stress test for a few hours and I've never blue-screened, so I'd be surprised at this).

1,0,0,1,0,"Guide to Undervolting Ryzen Mobile processors as of July 2021I have had 2 laptops now running the ryzen mobile platform, and have been thoroughly dissapointed with AMD's software support of their own CPU's, they perform pretty bad with the stock voltages and boost, mostly due to extreme thermals.

&amp;#x200B;

This could be said about intel CPU's as well as any processor running boost will programmatically keep boosting until they hit a power and / or thermal throttle, the difference being that intel mobile chips can be undervolted for the most part, many manufacturers locked down this ability but this can be undone by simply downloading older bios versions.

&amp;#x200B;

You cannot use Ryzen Master on the mobile platform currently, and i have yet to see a full-on overclock and processor control utility thus far for Ryzen mobile, the closest thing we have currently is [AMD APU Tuning Utility](

&amp;#x200B;

The program is great but it fails to provide the single most important control for overclockers - Voltage control.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a little program that isn't too well know and is misunderstood regarding how to use it by many which does actually allow you to lock core clocks down on all cores and set a constant voltage on most, if not all Ryzen mobile chips - 

&amp;#x200B;

[Helles Ryzen Test](

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this program isn't perfect and doesn't provide as many features as throttlestop or Intel XTU / Ryzen Master, but it does allow Voltage control, and can drastically improve your performance and temps while under load.

I have tested this program on a Ryzen 3750h and a Ryzen 3250u thus far and it works on both. It carries minimal risk and in worst case scenarios will crash your PC, but is fine after rebooting if the undervolt / clock is unstable.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the steps i use to OC / Undervolt my Mobile CPU's -

&amp;#x200B;

* Open Windows Power options, Go to processor power management, and set the following settings to these values :

1. ""Allow Throttle States"" = Disabled
2. ""Processor Performance Boost Policy"" -  0%
3. ""Processor Performance Boost Mode"" - Disabled
4. ""Minimum Processor State"" - 98%
5. ""Maximum Processor State"" - 99%

The reason we are locking the pstate betweeen 98-99%, is because this forces the processor to use the P1 state which can be freely modified in Ryzen Test, modifying P0 causes crashes instantly.

&amp;#x200B;

* Download and extract [Helles Ryzen Test]( then go to the folder to which you extracted the contents
* Right-click ""RyzenTest0.exe"", and go to properties, then navigate to the ""Compatibility"" tab, and check the box that says ""Run this program as an administrator""
* Click Apply / Ok, then run ""RyzenTest0.exe"", not the regular ""RyzenTest"", only the one that says ""RyzenTest0.exe"", a screen should pop up that looks like this, the values for clock and voltage will vary depending on CPU, note that i already have my p1 state set here - 



&amp;#x200B;

* Take a note on the exact values OF FID, DID, and VID In your P0 state and write them down, screenshot or type in notepad.
* Press the Up arrow next to ""Select P-State (p0-p2)"", this will allow you to modify the P1 state that your CPU is locked to now.
* Now that the P1 state is selected, first thing to do is to copy the DID value from the P0 state (middle slider bar), this is important because this modifies the FID (Frequency)
* Now change the value of the FID and VID to the ones you have in your P0 state
* Press ""YES"" in the bottom left corner, and check CPU-Z, If you did everything properly your processor should be running at its max advertised clock speed and voltage consistently and won't boost or downlclock
* This is where you can tinker around with your clock speeds (FID) and voltage (VID), My Ryzen 3750h runs very stable locked at 3.6 ghz (144 FID) with the VID Down to 120 (0.80v), i could probably go lower but haven't yet. you will have to run a decent bit of trial and error to find th sweetspot for your processor.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If your computer crashes or it doesn't work, try to run ""InstWinRing0.exe"" as an administrator, this is located in the same folder as RyzenTest0, reboot, and run RyzenTest0 again.

This program needs to be started every time you boot windows or the changes will not re-apply.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2020 I built a full AMD computer ( R5 3600 and RX 5600 XT ).

&amp;#x200B;

I hoped that with driver updates my graphics card would stop crashing Windows but it didn't. Most people say that the system failures and stuff have been fixed some time ago ( I believe it was in drivers version 20.9.1 ).

&amp;#x200B;

Through out all the time I've used this gpu I've had and still have 3 different problems. When I first bought the card I used to get bluescreen, then some time later with some driver updates I started having blackscreens and now, in the present, the screen just freezes on whatever I'm doing I can still hear the things on the background but I don't have any control on my PC, I can't move nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Apart from that, drivers still fail sometime I'm just watching a video on youtube or something and the screen suddendly turns black and then it turns back on saying that the driver failed, this is not that bad but I'm quite annoyed with the systems hangs.

&amp;#x200B;

Windows usually crashes when I'm doing less intensive stuff, as an example it crashes quite easily on Stardew Valley but a game that is a bit more intensive it is really really rare to crash.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly don't know what to do more I've tried DDUing the drivers many times, I've installed the drivers without the adrenaline software but nothing seems to work.

&amp;#x200B;

If you know of something I could try or a potencial fix please comment.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading.

If you're getting random reboots with your 5950x with no BSOD or error dumps, and only getting event viewer logs such as:

\- Kernel Power 41  
\- WHEA 18 Machine Check Exception / Cache Hierarchy Error / APIC ID: x

Try installing AMD Ryzen Master, and then click on Auto OC and apply. This fixed the reboot issues for me and I now have a stable system that has been running for 4 days with no restarts.

I don't know yet why this works I assume it must be a specific BIOS setting. My setup is:  
\- Ryzen 9 5950x  
\- ROG Crosshair VIII Dark Hero  
\- MSI Suprim x 3080Ti  
\- Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro SL 64GB (4x 16)  
\- Dark Power Pro 12 (1200W)  
\- OS installed on Samsung 970 and Samsung 960 for data

With all Windows Updates installed, latest AMD chipset, and latest BIOS version (3601) I would get random restarts several times a day, like sudden losses of power. Regardless of the system being under load or at idle. With auto restarts disabled there was no BSOD and the dump file wasn't written to at all.

I tested the RAM, Hard Drives, GPU and PSU separately and they all ran fine. I also ran all OCCT tests and everything passed.

I tried multiple BIOS configurations. SVM off, PBO, CPB and DOCP set to Auto, Enabled and Disabled. None of this made any difference to the restarts.

I then set DOCP, PBO and CPB to enabled, installed AMD Ryzen Master and set it to Auto OC. Since doing this I haven't had a single restart.

I am still wondering if I should RMA. IMO The processor should be stable at default.",x whea error random restart fixjust wanted share others try going rma route getting random reboots x bsod error dump getting event viewer log kernel power whea machine check exception cache hierarchy error apic id x try installing amd ryzen master click auto oc apply fixed reboot issue stable system running day restarts know yet work assume must specific bios setting setup ryzen x rog crosshair viii dark hero msi suprim x ti corsair vengeance rgb pro sl gb x dark power pro w o installed samsung samsung data window update installed latest amd chipset latest bios version get random restarts several time day like sudden loss power regardless system load idle auto restarts disabled bsod dump file written tested ram hard drive gpu psu separately ran fine also ran occt test everything passed tried multiple bios configuration svm pbo cpb docp set auto enabled disabled none made difference restarts set docp pbo cpb enabled installed amd ryzen master set auto oc since single restart still wondering rma imo processor stable default

AMD reported Q2 earnings yesterday...

Revenue is UP 99% year over year. EARNINGS up 352% ($0.54 cents expectations, $0.63 DELIVERED).

It beat expectations on GUIDANCE for next quarter ($4.1bn guidance vs $3.8 expectations).

In short, trifecta BEAT: REVENUE/EARNINGS/GUIDANCE

They reported buying 3.2 million shares back during Q2 (from their $4bn buy-back program).

The 3.2 million shares were bought for $256 million (at $80 per share).

....AND they have $3.8 billion in CASH, which means THEY ARE HAPPY TO BUY MORE!

AMD has business with GOOGLE, AMAZON, TESLA, MICROSOFT, SONY, SAMSUNG, VALVE, etc.

&amp;#x200B;



AMD has business with Google, AMAZON, TESLA, SONY, MICROSOFT and SAMSUNG

But.... there is SOMETHING SERIOUSLY wrong with AMD

As Don Clark tweeted yesterday (assistant news editor of the WSJ with over 40 years in the tech sector).

&amp;#x200B;

[



What is WRONG?... Simple: **SOME PEOPLE HATE IT.**

These individuals are commonly known as ""Shintels"" or ""Nvidiots"".

They hate AMD as they have competitive products, making some purchases seem stupid.

This may also explain why NVIDIA is trading at over TWICE the P/E of AMD...

NVIDIA has business with Nintendo. Forget about Sony, Microsoft, Samsung, etc.

**But I have an even better example, involving REDDIT**

I've been reporting on AMD for over 3 months.

My articles on this platform were recently banned. My profile was temporally blocked.

The arguments were ridiculous. Namely that I was **advertising** youtube content creators in my posts, as I included sources to my conclusions and analysis with links.

Think about it!.... I include sources to my posts and I am accused of advertising.

Advertising involves **PAYMENT**... and I got NOTHING to post my articles.

Not by the youtube tech analysts I quoted, not by anyone else.

**I basically got blamed for providing evidence to my arguments.**

Ridiculous arguments and excuses to support my posts being blocked.

&amp;#x200B;



I've studied LAW... which is HARD. Yet anyone can be an admin and censor with baseless grounds.

Studying  law is no easy feat. Understanding constitutional law, including our  very first amendment of the US Constitution, can easily distinguish the  notion of freedom of expression and advertising.

Yet,  those who consider themselves ""Bosses"", without the slightest knowledge  or understand of the law think otherwise. And they seem pretty  confident with their ignorance.

But I am still not sure if the new desktop I want can handle MSFS2020, and my old PC cannot handle most games because it only has 4gb of RAM and an Intel Celeron J1800 processor.

To recap, the test is prime95 using a single worker pinned to a single CPU core using large FFTs and disabling all AVX instructions.

Unfortunately I get a failure of this test, sometimes after around half an hour sometimes almost instantly, when I run it on Core 1 which is my ""best"" core according to hwinfo and ryzen master. Spot checking other cores including my second best, I can run for several hours before manually stopping the worker: so no failures. 

The actual error message is ""rounding was 0.5 expecting less than 0.4"".

Do you guys think I have a bad core on this processor and can you think of anything else I can do to try to diagnose it? Again this is a completely cleared CMOS so no overclocking, no overvolting, RAM at JEDEC, etc.  I don't think it's the RAM because I ran memtestx86 overnight and it passed everything, and I also kind of doubt it's the motherboard because then other cores would fail as well, but I'm looking for more ideas of possible before I start the RMA process with AMD.",diagnosing bad corei x processor planning overclocking using pbo curve optimization started anything wanted baseline completely reset cmos following guide ran stated stability test recap test prime using single worker pinned single cpu core using large ffts disabling avx instruction unfortunately get failure test sometimes around half hour sometimes almost instantly run core best core according hwinfo ryzen master spot checking core including second best run several hour manually stopping worker failure actual error message rounding expecting le guy think bad core processor think anything else try diagnose completely cleared cmos overclocking overvolting ram jedec etc think ram ran memtestx overnight passed everything also kind doubt motherboard core fail well looking idea possible start rma process amd

I was thinking of switching to a 5800x at 600 aud or 5600x for 400 aud, or stay in intel with a i9 10900KF at 600. Either way I have to change motherboards, replace the 5 year old power supply, and get 32gb ram or something from the 8gb 2666mhz I have. Overall it's approximately its a 900-1000 usd upgrade. I don't want to change my gpu as even someone less knowledgeable with this can see how much of a rip off it is right now.

The intel option of a 10900kf has 10 cores and 20 threads, but I still see people say a 5800x is better?

I'm not too knowledgeable about this, but my main question is how drastic of a change is the 5600x from the 5800x in terms of non-gaming usage like what I do? Is the 5800x worth the 200 dollars? (147 usd).

just getting a bit into OC at all. I try to get the best performance out of my 5600x.

At first i did PBO on advanced, PBO Limits disabled and then went into curve optimizer and put 30 negative in. Tried with Prime85 and Warzone. Worked stable and with higher boost clock then bevor. Getting more points in 3D Mark for CPU. Also the temps etc. everything is looking really good.

&amp;#x200B;

Also tried a bit with the override and was able to get 4,8GhZ Boost clock. 

&amp;#x200B;

If im right then what happens is that die CPU boost up to 4,8 for example and then run into the power limit of 75W. There it stops. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question now is... What if i did like bevor but also increase power limit. Would the CPU be able to boost even higher? Is there experience about that? What Power Limit is ""safe""? And where in Bios would i set them? Is it just under PBO Limits -&gt; Manual?

But in Feb I got myself a 3070, which was a hell of an upgrade over the 970 I had for like 5 years or so. 

Obviously there is now a bottleneck, though not necessarily a very obvious one. The only one I think this would be huge is Ark as I noticed that I had barely any performance increase in large bases between the 970 and the 3070.

Anyway, I've been wanting to upgrade for a while but I was always thinking ""what if Zen 4 comes out sooner rather than later"" but now looking at the even more recent news I can see it is still a while away. On top of that I now know it will likely be DDR5 too, which not only means I'd need new RAM but also means it will be expensive as all hell (I remember the move to DDR3 &amp; 4). 

So I guess I just want to have my thoughts validated. At this point, it's probably best to just get the best latest Ryzen I can afford, right? But then I feel like if I deal with the non-perfect performance for a while longer, I could instead start on a new generation instead of having to upgrade twice (since I will have to get a new MB since 1700 MB won't support the latest Zens).

But will the performance of Zen 4 be a significant increase over 5600x et al? No one knows I guess.

Sorry to blabber, I guess I just need someone to re-affirm that I should just upgrade to the best I can afford now and maybe wait for 2nd gen Zen 4 once any kinks are ironed out + prices settle a bit.

Let me know?",upgrade x better trusty since pretty much beginning certainly served well still great job day feb got hell upgrade like year obviously bottleneck though necessarily obvious one one think huge ark noticed barely performance increase large base anyway wanting upgrade always thinking zen come sooner rather later looking even recent news see still away top know likely ddr mean need ram also mean expensive hell remember move ddr guess want thought validated point probably best get best latest ryzen afford right feel like deal non perfect performance longer could instead start generation instead upgrade twice since get mb since mb support latest zen performance zen significant increase x et al one know guess sorry blabber guess need someone affirm upgrade best afford maybe wait nd gen zen kink ironed price settle bit let know

My  question is which one should I keep. Since the 6700xt has 12gb of VRAM I  feel like it is a bit more powerful and also future proof. But on the  other hand the difference might not be so big and the 3060ti is a bit  better for streaming because of the encoder that Nvidia GPUs have.

I'm conflicted and can use some help deciding on which CPU to get. If all else being equal, which is a better CPU: Ryzen 7 3750H (4C/8T/2.3) or Ryzen 3 Pro 4350G (4C/8T/3.8)?

I'm assuming 4350G is Zen 2 while 3750H is a previous generation? Both have the same number of cores and threads, and the single core turbo speed is the same at 4.0 GHz; although the 4350 appears to be able to run all the cores at 4.0 under load while the 3750H can't?

Is the Radeon 6 on the 4350G is a weaker GPU than the Vega 10? Fundamentally are they on the same graphics architecture so generally the higher frequency and more shader count a chip has the more data processing it can handle?

Out of the box my MSI B550 board was supplying the cpu with like 1.4V all core which seemed like way too much for stock speed, so I manually set the voltage to 1.2V. Unfortunately the only way to manually set the voltage is if you manually set the clock speed as well, which seems to get the CPU out of P-state and just lock on to whatever frequency you set. At ""auto"" speed and voltage it was boosting to the advertised 4.7 GHz under full load with max temp of 80C (I have an NH-D15 btw). In order to get that same performance with manual undervolt to 1.2V, I had to set the clock speed at 4.7 where it stays locked all the time. The max temp under load is now 72C and is around 10C cooler while gaming. I know that a lot of people say PBO + CO is the ""right"" way to overclock a Ryzen CPU but I really don't care about going far beyond  4.7 GHz. Anyways I also tried using the curve optimizer with a -30 voltage offset on all cores and it seems to be stable in benchmarks, however the temps are the same as stock under load, just the CPU is running faster, which makes sense given how curve optimizer works. In gaming the temps are slightly better than stock (50-60C with CO, 55-65 without) but nowhere near with manual overclock (40-50). So I guess my question is: Is it ""healthy"" for the system to run at this locked voltage and clock speed, or should I just accept slightly higher temps and set everything at auto except the curve optimizer? I'm really new to this so any help is appreciated.",x curve optimizer v manual undervolt trying get temp x low possible box msi b board supplying cpu like v core seemed like way much stock speed manually set voltage v unfortunately way manually set voltage manually set clock speed well seems get cpu p state lock whatever frequency set auto speed voltage boosting advertised ghz full load max temp c nh btw order get performance manual undervolt v set clock speed stay locked time max temp load c around c cooler gaming know lot people say pbo co right way overclock ryzen cpu really care going far beyond ghz anyways also tried using curve optimizer voltage offset core seems stable benchmark however temp stock load cpu running faster make sense given curve optimizer work gaming temp slightly better stock c co without nowhere near manual overclock guess question healthy system run locked voltage clock speed accept slightly higher temp set everything auto except curve optimizer really help appreciated

these are my current settings in bios:

[this was done with  everything on low so it made sure that  the cpu was the main power instead of the gpu and the resolution  is 800x600 as  you can see in the picture](

1,27,0,1,0,"Advice on which Ryzen CPU to get for a BuildSo essentially my teenage brother has been moaning recently that his 4-year old mid-range PC is starting to get a little slow. So I decided to try and win much older brother of the year award by getting him a PC for his birthday.

In essence, I'm basically putting a PC together based on parts I've replaced from my old PC over the years (effectively he gets my old 1080 Ti, 650W PSU, air cooler, case, and 3000MHz RAM) though I was planning to buy the motherboard and CPU new because I don't think a Z270 and i5-7600K would have much longevity.

Now original plan was to buy a new B550 and 3700x for his build. However (without humble bragging too much) I recently I got a substantial pay rise and I thought ""hey why don't I treat myself in the process"". So I started looking at Zen 3 CPUs with the idea of getting a Zen 3 for myself and then giving my brother the (just one year old) 3700x currently in my machine.

Now I'm reading around and it seems 5800x would be the best candidate for an upgrade but there are a few things throwing me off:

1) Lots of talk of it not being good value for money - though looking around it seems 5600x is just a sidegrade (at which point I should just stick to the original plan of just buying a new 3700x for my brother), the 5800x is selling for £350, whilst the 5900x is £500. So I'm just checking if this con disappeared at some point?

2) I'm slightly concerned by the reports about the thermals of the 5800x. My current 3700x pushes to 72C currently with my H115i Pro cooler and not helped by my 3080 FE having pushed up the case temperatures a bit.

Now I do mostly play games for the CPU stretching task, but one of the games is Total War: Warhammer 2 which I've noticed does benefit quite a bit from the Zen 3 single core performance boost.

So my question is should I be financially sensible and just stick to the original plan of getting a new 3700x or give myself a 5800x upgrade?",advice ryzen cpu get buildso essentially teenage brother moaning recently year old mid range starting get little slow decided try win much older brother year award getting birthday essence basically putting together based part replaced old year effectively get old ti w psu air cooler case mhz ram though planning buy motherboard cpu think z k much longevity original plan buy b x build however without humble bragging much recently got substantial pay rise thought hey treat process started looking zen cpu idea getting zen giving brother one year old x currently machine reading around seems x best candidate upgrade thing throwing lot talk good value money though looking around seems x sidegrade point stick original plan buying x brother x selling whilst x checking con disappeared point slightly concerned report thermal x current x push c currently h pro cooler helped fe pushed case temperature bit mostly play game cpu stretching task one game total war warhammer noticed benefit quite bit zen single core performance boost question financially sensible stick original plan getting x give x upgrade

I don't know much about overclocking so sorry if I mistook some things, I'm trying to do this because if I leave it as it is the temps are moving up and down from \~35 to 55c just by moving the cursor on desktop. I have a ryzen 5 3600 with a scythe mugen 5 revb cooler, tried to overclock it a few times with ryzen master, i'll add some pictures from my tests. Overall I get idle temps somewhere around 37-45c, in tests like cinebench and aida i get temps from 70 to 85 max, all of these after I set 4300 on all cores and 1.3125 voltage in ryzen master. I'll end up setting 4200 with 1.218v because i get lower max temps, but my questions are:

If I leave those settings like this, is it safe? 

Should I set those setting in bios and get rid of ryzen master? It seems like it's resetting everytime I reboot.

The voltage will stay permanently set at 1.3125 for example or it will vary depending by use and it will hit that max voltage at full usage? I'm asking this because in HWinfo I see the values are fixed, but in ryzen master clocks and voltage change by usage of pc.

How should I set precision boost overdrive in bios? If I leave it on enable or disabled, in ryzen master I see something like 90-100% of 120A at EDC, but if I leave it at advanced, I get like 60-70% of 120A EDC with the same scores in cinebench and temps.

Is it worth it to try to overclock my ram? I have two different brand sticks but with the same specs, 2x8gb 2133mhz cl15.

hi guys,  
So apparently I got some documentary\* 8k VR videos that I watch in VR using a RX6900XT + an Oculus rift S

The RX 6900 XT is a gaming-beast, no doubt, the only thing is when playing VR videos of 7k 8k or above it seems to struggle ? I'm not sure if it's because of the software or the limitation of the GPU itself ?

When I use my old 2080ti, everything is fine even 8k VR is smooth. But on 6900 XT, 7K 8K video is laggy, stutter, unwatchable, … but lower resolution 6k 5k 4k seems fine.

It's worth noting that with the 6900xt, when I play those 8k videos Flat on desktop using VLC player, it's also laggy, only when I use a player called 5kplayer, everything is smooth.

My setup:

Before swearing at me, I must say that before writing this post, I watched \~20 videos on YouTube and none were useful to me. ( Of course, I tried the advice I heard there in practice )

So I'll start over and try not to take a lot of your time.

Yesterday I finally replaced my faithful friend from 2013 (old PC)

At the moment my system is:

1. MSI x570 Unify ( last BIOS verison, not BETA )
2. Ryzen 5900X with AMD site chipset driver, rest from MSI site
3. CRUCIAL Ballistix Black DDR4 3600MHz 4x16GB (CL 16-18-18-38)
4. Be quite Silent base 802
5. Arctic liquid freezer 360 rev. 4
6. MSI 980 ti - ye ROFL, but this is workstation ;)
7. SSD Samsung 980 Pro 1Tb
8. PSU Be Quite 1000 Platinum

So. For some strange reason, the completely default BIOS settings ( u can see a screen ) give me a better overclocking + temperature results than any of the 20+ manuals.

1.1 [

1.1  This suits me, since the values+temps ​​are very good i guess. But according to simple logic, automatic OC cannot be better than manual tuning, or something has changed in 8 years ??? 

Last what ill trying on this system after &gt; Load default settings and enable XPM 1

1. Advanced CPU Configuration &gt; AMD Overclocking &gt; Precision Boot Overdrive ( Disable &gt; Advanced )
2.  PBO limits ( Auto &gt; Disabled )
3.  Curve optimizer ( Disabled &gt; All cores )
4.  All Core Curve Optimizer Sing ( Positive &gt; Negative )
5.  All Core Curve Optimizer Magnitude ( 0 &gt; ill try 30, 20 )  
PC will auto-reboot after \~30sec-1min on Windows idle loading...

I just dusted off a Vega 64 FE, it was purchased with air cooling but I added a EKWB block to it.

I've recently got back into Windows gaming and the Vega is still my fastest card.

I want to get the maximum performance out of it, what are the steps to take nowadays?

The game motivating me right now is Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 on Oculus CV1.

I see lots of posts from 2+ years ago but obviously nothing recent because a lot of people have moved on.  I see broken ""switch driver mode"" options, registry hacks, adrenalin drivers.  All I know is my ""performance"" settings only have the ""non existent"" fan settings, nothing about clocks...

It's still a decent card and the whole crypto coin price rort with video cards means I'm not going to buy something faster.

Thanks.

Richard",best way overclock vega fe hi dusted vega fe purchased air cooling added ekwb block recently got back window gaming vega still fastest card want get maximum performance step take nowadays game motivating right microsoft flight simulator oculus cv see lot post year ago obviously nothing recent lot people moved see broken switch driver mode option registry hack adrenalin driver know performance setting non existent fan setting nothing clock still decent card whole crypto coin price rort video card mean going buy something faster thanks richard

1,21,0,1,0,"What is the point of having 128 PCIe lanes on the Threadripper PRO, storage wiseI'm in charge of a large fleet of powerful workstations and I'm considering trying the Threadripper PRO hardware, but I don't understand its storage capacities.

The Threadripper PRO motherboards:

-Asus Pro WS WRX80E-SAGE SE WIFI
-Gigabyte WRX80-SU8-IPMI
-The one integrated in the Lenovo ThinkStation P620 workstation
-Supermicro M12SWA-TF

have few integrated storage slots and connectors, and they are focused on SATA and SAS. 

Both SATA and SAS protocols are slow for the highest end workstation of today, they were outclassed by NVMe M.2 devices, so I think they are present for compatibility purposes.

So if you want actual speedy storage, you are limited to either 2 or 3 M.2 slots. And if you want actual speedy storage in a relevant amount, you need to use the PCIe expansion slots. 

BUT, the hardware for ""NVMe M.2 to PCIe"" adapters in the desktop (as in ""not server"") is limited, as far as I know, to:

a) Asus Hyper M.2 X16 Gen 4 Card, with mixed opinions on its reliability even when using only one (I doubt populating 5 or 6 of these, with each one holding 4 M.2 devices would keep working 24x7 for months)

b) Dubious Aliexpress grade devices, limited to holding only 1 or 2 M.2 devices because they are still PCIe 3.0 .


It seems that all the reliable ""NVMe M.2 to PCIe"" adapters were designed for a rack mounted server and not for an ATX motherboard. It makes sense because the Threadripper PRO line are basically EPYC CPUs.

But, since Intel still owns the server market due to it's shady business practices and they aren't interested in PCIe 4.0 , I don't think there is even a server grade PCIe 4.0 adapter (it might be, I didn't check Dell and so because even if there is, it wouldn't work in this form factor)

Given this situation:

-Can you actually use the PCIe expansion slots for storage? Or the 128 PCIe lanes for that matter?

-Are you limited to use a Fibre Channel device adapter, connected through fibre cables to a external datacenter grade array? ... in a workstation hardware?

-If you are limited to Fibre Channel for actual speedy storage in a relevant amount, then what are the 128 PCIe lanes for? Just for stuffing 7 graphic cards?

1,5,0,1,0,"Threadripper appropriate for my workload?Hi,

Currently, I work as a software developer who is feeling the pain of slow compile times and my PC being near-unusable while doing so. I also do a lot of virtualization which doesn't scale well on my current 8-core Intel CPU.

I guess that begs the question - is Threadripper the better option in this use case? If there is any other software developer that has made the jump, sharing your experiences would be awesome.

I do also have a few other questions when it comes to Threadripper and AMD in general:

* If I do decide to go with Threadripper, is it worth waiting for the Zen 3 Threadrippers?
* Unfortunately, I still have a few tasks that can still only be ran on a single core. How bad is Threadripppers single core performance on the 32/64 core count SKU currently compared to high-end Ryzen?
* I know gaming isn't the primary purpose of Threadripper, but I do wish to know what hoops I might have to jump through if I wanted to run current AAA games on it and what performance is like. If possible, I'd rather not build 2 separate PCs for work and personal use.
* How good is AMD's low-level debugging and profiling tools? I am quite used to VTune currently and would like to know the differences/limitations compared to AMD's uProf.

Any suggestions/help would be greatly appreciated.

Initially I bought the 3600Mhz CL14 Force Xtreem which was like way overpriced so I canceled it (yeah I did a bit of research about timings but didn't understand much) so now I might have to return this ram and get the 3600. 

If anyone else has other recommendations like the Neos, or Corsairs then it's fine. I don't mind spending upto £500 but want the best possible ram. 

Without editing, I'm usually just working and I tend to leave my tabs open yeah some of them I keep open and forget about them like I'm reading something so not sure why but my habit is costing me like 3-5GB in memory.

1,24,0,1,0,"Another RAM question, your feedback would be GREATLY appreciated.I am sorry to start yet another RAM post, but I am really struggling at choosing RAM for my new build. 

I have a 5900x and a x570 Dark Hero MB. 

From research I understand that the Memory IC will perform best in a dual rank setup (4xSingle Rank DIMMS, 2 x Dual Rank DIMMs)

I also understand that my board is Daisy Chain Vs T-Topology for Memory, and that Daisy Chain performs best with 2 DIMMs.  

I am aiming for 1900 IF OC w/ 32GB of 3800Mhz RAM with as tight timing as I can get (c16 1T).

I understand that Samsung B-Die and Micron E-Die are the best chances at making this possible. 

Now here is my dilemma, aesthetically I am making a blackout build and need black heat spreader RAM (non rgb) and I am having an incredibly difficult time finding Dual Rank 16Gig sticks in either chip type that aren't &gt; $300.

I have found the following two kits

BL2K8G36C16U4B Crucial Ballistix (Micron E-Die) 2 x 8G Single Rank Dimm @ 3600 C16 $93

PVB416G400C9K Patriot Viper Blackout (Samsung B-Die) 2 x 8G Single Rank Dimm @ 4000 C19 $123

1. If I chose 2 of either of the previously mentioned kits for 4 x 8G Single Ranks is the chance to hit my target OC dramatically smaller?
2. Outside of the OC, how much of a performance hit will be seen with a Daisy Chain memory topology with 4 sticks?
3. Is it worth the extra $100 to just buy this kit  F4-3600C14D-32GVK G-Skill Ripjaws V 2 x 16GB Dual Rank @ 3600 Mhz C14 (Samsung B-Die)

1,41,0,1,0,"Lower AMD GPU idle power consumption on 144Hz or WQHD or else monitors 

Heyho Gamers and ecologically conscious people,

if you're like me, you want to have your GPU as cool as possible with the lowest temparature avaiable... At least on idle.

Meanwhile, having a montior which supports everything besides 1080p 60Hz (for example running on WQHD 144Hz) issues a fully occupied memory and following from this a higher power consumption (33 Watt on idle on my RX5700 XT) and temparature.

To fix this, we will go into our beloved AMD Radeon Software. Then, go to Options --&gt; Display. In there we want to create a new custom resolution with all the same as usual but setting the ""Timing-Standard"" to ""CVT-reduced utilization"" (translation may vary - I'm using the german version). After applying these settings your power consumption will go sub 10Watts. If needed, I will post some screenshots in here.

DISCLAIMER: If u follow these steps and there is something like ""this setting is not avaiable for your display"", this could depent on your used cable (HDMI or DP). By my on own experience i can tell, that using DP fixes this issue.

Specs:

* 5900X
* Corsair H115i Platinum AIO  2x 140 MM ML fans set at 1200 RPM - Pump at Extreme
* Ambient Temp 25 C (Texas Summers, yay!)
* Noctua NT-H1 TIM
* 9.5 mm Top Y offset, 8.6 mm bottom Y offset, no X offset

I replaced the TIM first to ensure my numbers weren't impacted by older TIM, let the machine idle for 10+ minutes to cool down, then ran 10 min CB23 to start and heat things up.  I did not close out all my background apps as I wanted to see how this would change daily use temps and benchmark tests.

On the other side full all core load with Cinemabench was yielding only 12 degree difference (high sixties / lower seventies). This couldn't be right - so I've checked my cooler mounting and paste but it was fine so I've stared to look for the cause elsewhere. What caught my attention was the fact that both CCUs temp were around 30-40 degree while Tdie temp was sitting above 60. The next thing which caught my attention was SOC Voltage (in HWInfo) being shown as 1.85 which is far much higher then anything I've ever seen on Ryzen Calculator screenshoots from internet.    


Going into the bios and into tweaker tab welcomed me with 1.2V max SOC voltage. Settting this manually to 1.05 Volts resulted in a MASSIVE drop in CPU temp.

I have read that this is normal and per AMD specifications, but it still seemed too hot and I wanted to reduce it if possible without a noticeable performance loss, especially since my CPU wasn't even being fully utilized \~75%. I've been playing around with PBO and the curve optimizer, but whether I enable or disable PBO, curve optimizer down to -20 or more, reapply thermal paste, nothing seemed to affect temperatures. At one point, I even moved my PC to the opposite side of the room, below a window and near the A/C with cold air blowing in, and even that didn't even help lower it beyond 1-2C.

Finally, I read some random comment in a thread recommending undervolting using the offset, instead of through curve optimizer. I switched it to -0.075 offset per the recommendation in that comment and bam - instant success. Averaging almost 10C lower in Warzone and framerates are very similar. I haven't been benchmarking (as Warzone seems a fairly effective benchmark and arguably more effective stress test since the temps went even higher than any benchmark I had previously tried). So I'm not sure on the exact performance loss you can expect, but I'll happily take a very minimal loss for the 10C.

Wanted to share in case anyone else is having the same issue, and is concerned despite AMD's claim that this is normal.",psa amd x undervolt reduce high temp similar performancei finished build week ago pretty happy aside fact cpu temp averaging c peaking c demanding game like warzone read normal per amd specification still seemed hot wanted reduce possible without noticeable performance loss especially since cpu even fully utilized playing around pbo curve optimizer whether enable disable pbo curve optimizer reapply thermal paste nothing seemed affect temperature one point even moved opposite side room window near c cold air blowing even even help lower beyond c finally read random comment thread recommending undervolting using offset instead curve optimizer switched offset per recommendation comment bam instant success averaging almost c lower warzone framerates similar benchmarking warzone seems fairly effective benchmark arguably effective stress test since temp went even higher benchmark previously tried sure exact performance loss expect happily take minimal loss c wanted share case anyone else issue concerned despite amd claim normal

I was recently approved to get my Ryzen 5 3600 RMA'd due to it spontaneously ceasing to function and giving me DRAM errors/no longer booting even to the BIOS when I've tested all of my other individual components to be working fine without it.

I was wondering if it is necessary for me to send the CPU in its' original packaging? Such as the gray box it origianlly came in.

I looked at AMD's packing instructions, however they only mentioned to not include the heatsink/fan (the cooler it came with) and to put the CPU in its' clamshell packaging so as to protect it during shipping. I no longer have the original packaging, so I'm asking this before shipping it off, or if they need that to confirm the serial number or something.

Maybe there is a better card out there, but it would have to be under $2500 for me to even consider because I'll be eating nothing but top ramen for months as is.

&amp;#x200B;

After many years I have decided to build an AMD system instead of Intel for a multitude of reasons the (least of which is that their vendors screwed me on delivery dates 6 months in a row) and if if the benchmarks I've seen are to be believed they're a much better value than Nvidia as well - I don't care about the gaming aspects as I will be using this only for OpenCL or ROCm (unless you can tell me I can Mario Kart 64 in 8K). I am aware that Nvidia's advantage is oversold is mostly because of a bias with game developers optimizing for Nvidia more than they do AMD, and the same can be said of AI developers.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not familiar with AMD's marketing nomenclature so I was hoping someone could shed some light on what to invest my money in: I've narrowed my choices to the recently released Radeon Pro W6800 and the slightly older but float point crunching monster Radeon RX 6900 XT. 

&amp;#x200B;

It would appear a considerable feature of the pro is the fact it has ECC RAM where as the XT does not; but I have been unable to verify that. It is also very nice that it eats less power and defecates less heat.

&amp;#x200B;

For my purposes ECC RAM is most likely far more important than a slightly (&gt;=\~12.%) performance gain. If the 6900XT does have variants out there with ECC memory I would be inclined to go with that because I don't think any of my models will ever reach anywhere near 32 GB.

&amp;#x200B;

Given the fact the two are so close pricing right now it makes the most sense to go for the Pro but before throwing down my life savings I figured I would humble myself and ask the advice of the AMDarmada.",radeon rx xt v radeon pro w scientific computation tl dr machine learning computationally heavy work looking best bang buck prefer accuracy speed maybe better card even consider eating nothing top ramen month x b many year decided build amd system instead intel multitude reason least vendor screwed delivery date month row benchmark seen believed much better value nvidia well care gaming aspect using opencl rocm unless tell mario kart k aware nvidia advantage oversold mostly bias game developer optimizing nvidia amd said ai developer x b familiar amd marketing nomenclature hoping someone could shed light invest money narrowed choice recently released radeon pro w slightly older float point crunching monster radeon rx xt x b appear considerable feature pro fact ecc ram xt unable verify also nice eats le power defecates le heat x b purpose ecc ram likely far important slightly performance gain xt variant ecc memory inclined go think model ever reach anywhere near gb x b given fact two close pricing right make sense go pro throwing life saving figured humble ask advice amdarmada

Enhance 7660b 600W

2x140mm radiators in a custom loop for both GPU and CPU.

In short: the computer would boot 1/20th of the time and when it did, it would crash within 5 minutes.

I ran through every possible hardware component down to the CPU and that was the problem. I RMAd it and this new CPU allows the system to function normally. I'm going to overclock again but I don't want to kill another CPU.

One would think if there was any degradation of overvoltage it would still be stable at stock settings at leadt. And if there was some instability at my OC I'm sure I would have noticed before this failure.

If anything stands out I would love to know. Because of my limited power I haven't been copy/pasting other peoples' 300W settings. I'm aiming for 200.

My cinebench r23 multiscore was somewhere around 28600 with the 205W overclock. Clocks were around 4.45GHz.

1,31,0,1,0,"AMD now has three performance enhancing technologies, FFX Contrast Adaptive Sharpening (CAS), FFX Super Resolution (FSR), and Radeon Boost. Can any of these technologies play well with any of the others?(Not a tech person.) 
 
All three of the technologies do almost the same thing, adjusting internal resolution in response to input or performance, but they all work in different ways.  
  
CAS does dynamic resolution scaling and sharpening.  (Sort of like a poor man's FSR.)  
  
Radeon Boost dynamically adjusts resolution in response to player input.  (It therefore reduces the internal resolution and boosts performance during moments of action, when there are a lot of key presses.)  
  
FSR renders at a lower internal resolution then resamples it up to a higher resolution, it also has options for dynamic scaling.   
  
I've only had occasion to try CAS (in Cyberpunk), and Boost (in Destiny 2), both of them, I felt, were a reasonable tradeoff between performance and image quality, and from what I've read FSR is even better!  In my opinion AMD has three pretty fucking fantastic performance enhancement technologies, they all do *sorta* the same thing, but they do it in response to different circumstances.  
  
My question: Is FSR the death of CAS and Boost (both of which I have an entirely irrational fondness for), or is there a way that FSR, CAS, and Boost can play well together, or enhance each other?

It just pisses me off to know AMD has been sandbagging the APU products for years since Lisa Sue took over. Yes, they are more profitable now but they completely sidelined the product that kept them in business while their CPUs and GPUs were flopping. APUs were literally greater than the sum of their parts. Now intel has competitive IGPS and AMD is catching up. The point is AMD needs to put APUs back into the forefront as it one of their best products.

As there's no bios support for the 5000 series, I decided to grab a €220 R7 3700X as it was on discount.

It's turned out to be a fantastic upgrade. I'm using CTR 2.1 to have individual OC profiles and this thing can overclock amazingly well. I've only had it for a day, haven't really messed around with OC too much, but I can run it at 4.4GHz all core at 1.275V and for single core I run it at 4.6Ghz with 1.4V. Temperatures never go above 75C with a cheap Thermalright True Spirit direct cooler. 

I tested it at 4.7Ghz but it crashed after a few runs of single core Cinebench R23 so I dialled it back to 4.6Ghz. For all core, I could get it to run at 4.5Gz at 1.325, but temperatures went above 80C so I dialled it back to 4.4 at a lower voltage and it works amazingly well.

1,104,0,1,0,"I often see the question of which games should have FSR, but I'd like to set aside the ""should"" and ask what games could potentially -benefit the most- from FSR?There was a time, not so long ago, when the question ""Yes, but can it play Crysis?"" wasn't a cliche or a punchline, it was a real and sincere question; Crysis, in many ways, wasn't just months ahead of its time, but years.  

If Crysis had FSR when it dropped the question ""Can it play Crysis?"" would have been asked about iGPUs instead of dGPUs.  If Crysis had FSR on the day it dropped then millions more people could have enjoyed the game at launch.  
  
What games, if any, are the Crysis of our generation?  
  
Unfortunately I can't offer a ton of insight, I'm on a Vega 64, I can crank up Monster Hunter World's settings until I have FPS in the single digits; from my perspective MHW could benefit tremendously from FSR, but that says more about my hardware than it does about the game itself.  
  
For the sake of discussion, since there aren't a *ton* of Crysis like games out there right now, I'll broaden the question a little bit: Some games, like anything competitive, benefit directly from increased framerates, even above and beyond a monitor's refresh rate.  
  
Also for the sake of the discussion, let's assume that adding FSR to an existing game costs zero dollars and takes zero minutes.  Consider this a wishlist, of sorts.",often see question game fsr like set aside ask game could potentially benefit fsr time long ago question yes play crysis cliche punchline real sincere question crysis many way month ahead time year crysis fsr dropped question play crysis asked igpus instead dgpus crysis fsr day dropped million people could enjoyed game launch game crysis generation unfortunately offer ton insight vega crank monster hunter world setting fps single digit perspective mhw could benefit tremendously fsr say hardware game sake discussion since ton crysis like game right broaden question little bit game like anything competitive benefit directly increased framerates even beyond monitor refresh rate also sake discussion let assume adding fsr existing game cost zero dollar take zero minute consider wishlist sort

1,20,0,1,0,"First AMD CPU, There is no coming backAfter many years of being a loyal Intel customer having owned Core2Due, Core2Quad, i3 3210, i5 4590, i7 4790K, i5 8400 and lastly i7 9700K, I decided to give AMD 5600x a try to pair the CPU with my Gigabyte Aorus 6800XT.

Its was a love from the first boot, outperformed my previous 9700K 8 cores at 5.2ghz in each and every game I played and on every single core benchmark (R20, R23).

Runs as cool as mountain breeze, on custom loop the temps never exceeds 65c with fans (360 rad) set at 1200rpm for silent operations, compared to 1600rpm on 9700k and barely keeping the temps at 70c.

Overclocking, who needs Intel hassle, voltage, LLC...etc when you have PBO 2, easy as slicing a cake, hell, you dont even need to overclock the CPU just yet, its already a beast out of the box

I tried PBO enabled, disabled and advanced with multiple tweaks on scalar and curve Optimizer.

I barely noticed a difference -if any- in gaming edition except better thermals and lower noise.

On PBO disabled my CPU barely reaches 52c, PBO enabled and overclocked 57c and 62c respectively.

Its a beast, when and if you get it dont bother overclocking for gaming performance, you will notice a difference on 1440p.

&amp;#x200B;

Bottom line: For me and I speak for my self, I'll never go back to Intel, that 5600x cost me 280$, that's a bargain for the performance and temps I get. I just love my 5600x.

This is my first AMD card, I've been using Nvidia all my life but I hated my time with amd for a few reason. One of the most important thing is encoding. I record my ps5 and xbox series x footage via elgato and 6800xt doesn't support 4k 60fps recording, it only support 30fps. I do understand 6800xt has a massive performance boost over 3070. Around 20-25% fps boost depending on the game which is a lot and since I'm a gamer fps matters to me over everything else but now Im considering getting a 3070 from someone by trading the 6800xt and getting £200 cash on top.

Recently i just built a pc with a 5600x. i am still on the stock cooler cause im using a gt 1030, so temps are low anyways cause of the bottleneck. (hoping to get a 3060ti FE) i was looking into the thing about pbo2, and i have alot of questions about it.

1. does a cmos reset clear pbo2 settings from under the advanced overclocking menu? MSI B550 gaming edge wifi
2. will this do anything on stock cooler? i have managed a perfectly stable oc of 4525mhz at 1.15v (all cores) will pbo 2 give me lower temps?
3. can frequency alone degrade a cpu? lets say i run an oc of 3300mhz at 1.3 v and 4800mhz at 1.3v. (just an example) can the frequency alone degrade my cpu?
4. what do all the options do? like the overdrive scalar, limits, etc.",x pbo stock cooler recently built x still stock cooler cause im using gt temp low anyways cause bottleneck hoping get ti fe looking thing pbo alot question cmos reset clear pbo setting advanced overclocking menu msi b gaming edge wifi anything stock cooler managed perfectly stable oc mhz v core pbo give lower temp frequency alone degrade cpu let say run oc mhz v mhz v example frequency alone degrade cpu option like overdrive scalar limit etc

1,19,0,1,0,"I have been seeing problems since drivers 21.3.2 but I may have found a solution for AMD DRIVER TIMEOUT ERRORLet me say that AMD drivers, are something that most people find atrocious, so far I have never had problems since version 13, so I had a pretty much long way before this. Until the version 21.3.2 started giving me the Driver Timeout Error, and I had no real explanation so I moved back to the stable 20.12.1 version.   


After doing quite an extensive Job, seeing what is and not working, even I updated to Windows 11, and same problem. I just decided to stop there, Clean Install, and then, magically everything went great. Until I need one feature and then the problem came back.   


For my use, I have a Huawei phone that uses a Huawei Share thing, that can connect the phone via WIFI as a device on the network as having another PC, being faster than the normal cable connection, even USB3.0, but for that to work they use the **SMB 1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support,** I can't tell It was the problem since I have been using the feature since I got the phone and that dates back to 2019.   


For my clean install I did not activated the Feature, and I was running already 21.6.2 Optional Version, having zero problems so far. As soon I needed a file from my phone, I enabled it, and after a while a DRIVER TIMEOUT ERROR, and the same black screen.   


So I just deactivated and let the system work as usual and wait if the same bug would happen, to my surprise it didn't happen again.   


For reference I will leave my current system specs:  


i7 3770  
8 GB DDR3 1600 MHZ Common Kingston Modules  
480 SSD Adata  
2 TB Seagate for Games  
Asus p8h61-m lx3  
RX 460 Gigabyte Windforce 4GB  


Tested with:  
Windows 11 Pro 22000.65   
Windows 10 Pro 19043  


Main reason I'm sharing this I had been trying to solve this myself and searching for help but seems no one knows exactly. Best solution I got is from AMD and just using the Windows Update Driver Version, but even if that works good, we loose all the Radeon Software capabilities along like Streaming or Recording.   


If this helps anyone, I'm glad. If not maybe we can try to see how to solve it as a community, since I have used this kind of forums for helping me, I feel I can contribute now.

1,42,0,1,0,"PSA: Thermal pads need compression to get their ""rated"" thermal conductivity ratingTL;DR: Thermal conductivity is only one mechanical property to take a look at when buying replacement thermal pads. Thickness, the compression it was tested at and the hardness will also play a factor in your performance. Every GPU will be built differently with different gap sizes. Determining the best thermal pad solution will require a little bit of thinking.

There have been a lot of post about changing thermal pads to lower memory temperatures. Sometimes I see some post where users A reports great results on GPU model ASUS and user B tries the same with a different model Power Color and gets mixed results.

User B purchased the same thermal pads as user A, so why aren't they getting the same results?

This might be an obvious answer to some of you. I'm writing this as a PSA for those that aren't aware that **thermal conductivity rating of pads vary with how much compression is applied.** User A and B have different card manufacturers, they might have different gaps between their cooling solution and their module (memory, chokes, etc.).

Thermal impedance is the inverse of thermal conductivity, so in the test below, lower is better.

&amp;#x200B;

[ A test done by  ](

As you can see, the more the pad was compressed, the higher the thermal conductivity (or lower the thermal impedance) became.

This is important because I know a lot of people like to purchase based off of the highest thermal conductivity rating they can find. Lets take Gelid Ultimate as an example. It has a thermal conductivity rating of 15 W/mK, but look at what they on their test.



The thermal pad was compressed to 60%. They did a test on a 1mm thick pad and compressed it to a 0.6mm thickness to get this rating.

Furthermore, the shore hardness of this pad is quite hard. Applying this much pressure would probably bend a board.

[ Picture for shock value purposes only ](

Careful now, too much compression can break solder joints, damage modules, etc. So going too thick, applying too much compression is dangerous.

What about thermal putty? Thermal putty is interested because it is more malleable and closer to a paste than it is a hard pad. Putties don't need as much compression or compression at all to get their full thermal conductivity rating.

[A plus with putty pads is that they can compress down significantly — much farther than viscoelastic pads. They require a minimum amount of compression; at least 10%. They also relax over time. Standard gap fillers and putty gap filler pads have essentially the same performance for a given gap. They are soft, and eventually they will bottom out past 80% — what’s referred to as densification. The material is no longer flowing, and is being crushed.](

**First before making any changes to registry make a system restore point.**
_____________


So while browsing the registry I noticed the string here  
[ 

You can change this yourself by windwos+r and typing Regedit then press enter


Navigate to  


    Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4d36e968-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\0000
    

And then see if KMD_RebarControlMode exists and if it does not right click -&gt; new dword 32bit and put the name 

    KMD_RebarControlMode


And set the value to hexidecimal value 1



If you don't want to use registry editor you can just run this script here to automatically do it


You can make your own file by opening notepad and pasting this code.


    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
    
    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4d36e968-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\0000]
    ""KMD_RebarControlMode""=dword:00000001


Save the file Rebar.reg and then run the reg file once you saved it. This will enable Rebar in AMD graphics driver

To disable rebar you can run


    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
    
    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4d36e968-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\0000]
    ""KMD_RebarControlMode""=dword:00000000

Same as before name it as Rebaroff.reg and run it.

Event viewer shows multiple different reasons, ""unexpected  shutdowns"" ""unable to write error dump"" and so on.

Thought it might be my psu but not only is it an amazing and way over powered, OCCT and other HW info show it as being rock solid stable.

Thought it might be my Graphics card, Vram tests show no issues, GPU tests show no issues.

Multiple mem tests show memory is fine.

Then I did a search on Google and asked Ryzen idle reboot, crash.

The first post I saw said ""was reading discord and my pc shutdown!"" ""gaming doesn't cause it"" next post ""reading reddit and pc shut down.

All of us have AMD performance settings, no power savings turned on and the only theme seems to be Ryzen PC's being idle.

From what I have read it could be something to do with low power state and the voltage going bellow the needed amount to keep the cpu functioning.

Tried most of the fixes.

I am noticing poor performance that is all over the place and it seems one of the main reasons is that the clocks aren't staying consistent in the less demanding games. It seems like games that are very intensive like cyberpunk (solid 60 at 1440p max settings) and Metro Exodus(solid 90-110 max settings) run great, but games like overwatch and other high frame rate ""simpler"" games are terribly inconsistent. For example my 1080ti is running overwatch at 240 fps at 1080p  constant will virtually no dips. The 6800 will, but it randomly drops all the way down to the 160s-170s and then back up and down all over again.

Drivers are up to date, DDU has been done, I've tried manually setting the clock speeds and power limits, fan curve and all that and it seems the card basically ignores it in most games. Just super disappointed at the moment this card that on paper is excellent and packs a wallop for its price is struggling to compete with a card that is what 4 years old at this point? I've read several threads with similar issues but let me know if AMD has an official solution for this yet as its been almost 8 months since release.

1,18,0,1,0,"What Infinity Fabric clock speeds (FCLK) are people achieving on their TR 39XX?Hi everyone,

I got a TR 3990x running currently on a Gygabyte Aorus Extreme TRX40 mobo (crap board btw) and coupled with 8 x Gskill Neo 3800 sticks CL14 (timings are actually 14-16-16-36). By default on XMP memory profiles, the system would boot with FCLK at 1800 but memory is at 1900. So I would like to run on 1:1 parity and I was interested if anyone has succesfully ran stable a 3000 series TR with FCLK @ 1900 (mine doesn't post or if it does it quickly becomes unstable).

The whole system, except ram, is under water and I run a 4 GPU system.

So I'm forced to either to downclock the RAM to like 3600 and maybe attempt to tigthen the timings or go agove that like 3666 or 3733 and push the fabric a tad over 1800 for 1:1 parity. My problem is my mobo is crap and won't default BIOS post with 4 GPUs, giving a POST error d4 which can ONLY be bypassed if I get into bios and disable CSM support and enable Above 4G decoding (both are inversely defaulted). So if system becomes unstable, won't post or fails to train the memory timings, I have to disconnect 2 of the GPUs of the 4, without braking the loop apart, get rid of d4 error and then try the bios settings.

So yeah, anyway, I was curious if anyone got 1900 fabric running stable or that's some kind of unicorn for TRs! I'm trying to see if I got a shitty binned CPU or that's the norm.

1,2,0,1,0,"Anybody undervolting 5800X on B450M Mortar or other MSI mobo with Lite BIOS?Hi All,

Just picked up a 5800X this weekend and so far so good, but compared to the 3700X my average temps are way higher. I have it under a Scythe Fuma 2 with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut. Temps were ranging from 65-75 in Warzone last night, and peaked at 84.1C in OCTT under full load; VRMs only got up to 69C. These CPU temps are quite a bit higher than my 3700X under the same cooler with Arctic Silver. I realize we're talking about chips with way different TDPs and IPCs, so maybe this is normal; open to feedback/insights/experiences from others here.

Anyway, I've had great results undervolting my RTX 3080 to keep temps low with an overclock, and would like to at least undervolt the 5800X, if not undervolt and overclock. I'm not new to any of this, but navigating the AGESA [1.2.0.2]( light beta BIOS has me a bit confused, especially with the duplication of some settings between panes. I realize I can do most of this in Ryzen Master, but I'd really like to get this done in the BIOS level in case I throw Arch Linux on here.

I'd lose all video, and the fan would spin at max speed. My system was fine - I could still hear my friends in Discord, and they could hear me. My video card was dying. 

I've always known this thing runs hot. In most games I was averaging about 82C. I decided to repaste my card and followed this [guide]( 

After reassembly, the problem seemed to be worse. I was crashing at my desktop now. I fired up hwinfo64 and saw that the GPU hotspot temp was sitting at 90c at just the desktop. As soon as I started any graphics processing, it'd shoot up to 106c, and then the video would crash. 

Okay - so it seemed like a cooling issue, and not a dead component issue. These are the resources I used to guide my fix: 

The suspected location of the hotspot sensor according to several blogs is [here]( on the chip. 

Info from this [post]( encouraging the use of more paste was the real kicker for me. 

I put on a gratuitous amount of paste, used a latex gloved finger to wedge it into the gap between the GPU and the HBM, and then made sure it was evenly spread on the chips and vapor chamber.

I then followed this [guide]( for tightening up the cooler. DO NOT SKIP THIS. 

I seated the vapor chamber as tight as I could without stripping the screws. 

I also set my fan curve to be much more aggressive in Wattman. 

My new temps are much better. My hotspot hasn't gone above 90c.

I apologize if I am asking a repeated questions. This is my first time doing this and online forums give me conflicting information. From what I understand, it is best practice to do a fresh install of Windows when making a full on motherboard switch to make sure drivers don't conflict.

Could someone outline the steps in detail that I would need to take to make this change in a safe and effective manner? This is what I have gathered from forums and videos so far.

1. Backup any file data (pictures, videos, documents, game save files, etc...)

2. Create a boot USB of Windows 10 from their website. (I already have tied my digital license to my Windows Account)

3. Format my current SSD with Windows 10 Home Edition to clear it.

3. Move my cleared SSD to my new motherboard. Install the fresh copy of Windows 10 using my boot USB. Login to my account to transfer over the license. 

4. Re-install any programs and files that I had on my old platform.

I'm pretty new to the PC game having built my machine last summer and I had questions about running my gpu fans all the time.

I have two monitors (Main: 165hz, Secondary: 144hz), and like all of you when I run both at their maximum refresh rate my GPU MCLK spikes to max and stays there even if the PC is idling. I know why this happens, but was wondering if this is bad for the overall longevity of my GPU. In theory the fans running all the time would cause more wear and tear, but is this negligible over the life span of a card I intend to use for 3-5 years?

Or am I better off capping my refresh rate at 120hz and letting the card idle at a lower MCLK?

All opinions welcome, and thanks in advance!",looking guidance experienced hobbyistshi pretty game built machine last summer question running gpu fan time two monitor main hz secondary hz like run maximum refresh rate gpu mclk spike max stay even idling know happens wondering bad overall longevity gpu theory fan running time cause wear tear negligible life span card intend use year better capping refresh rate hz letting card idle lower mclk opinion welcome thanks advance

just go into the debug console and run the asw launch command and set it to make 90 fps and it will work just load up task manager before you run it while a game is running and then press enter and watch the gpu usage drop

1,81,0,1,0,"My experience with AMD Ryzen 5 4650GI made the original post on a local subreddit 3 months back. I just wanted to share my happiness with the folks at r/Amd

I wanted to build a cheap PC which can game and will have generally good performance. I have been trying to get a cheap GPU like the RTX 2060 Super or GTX 1660 Super, but i was out of luck. No retailer had those cards in stock and the RTX 3060 and RTX 3060Ti were out of stock and/or sold at double their launch price set by Nvidia. I even asked a local shop about a custom pc with Intel Core i5-10400F (he didn't have 3600) and a RTX 3060. He quoted me a price of RS 1.15 lakhs ($1540), which was wayyy above my budget. I turned to the used market then, only to be disappointed yet again. Most of the used graphics cards were literally being sold above their msrp at which they launched, which is ridiculous!!

Dejected, I went back to the drawing board, and hoped to build a system with AMD Ryzen 5 3400G and later, maybe after 1-2 years, install a brand new GPU in the system. I looked up AMD Ryzen 5 3400G reviews. I was surprised to know the 3400G didn't in fact use the Ryzen 3000 series processor as the name suggests. Instead, it uses an older Ryzen 2000 series CPU and a Vega 11 GPU cores. I was disappointed again. I don't want to buy a 4 year old CPU right? That's when I started to notice a strange CPU being pushed by the youtube algorithm to me.

AMD Ryzen 5 4650G Pro. That's a lot of terms for a single product. The 4650G is an OEM only processor as far as i know, it is based on the AMD Ryzen 3000 series 7nm architecture. It has performance similar to the Ryzen 5 3600 and actually scored similar to the 3600 in geekbench 5, which is the only benchmark I ran. Anyway, I was surprised that AMD has not released the 4650G as a boxed product. It's an incredible product at times like this. I googled where I could buy the 4650G online in India, and I was directed to the product page of MDComputers. Well, I placed my order for a 4650G (Rs 17,260, $230) along with an A520m motherboard. I know, I know, A520 isn't the best AMD motherboard chipset out there, it doesn't support Overclocking, and is pretty entry level, but it supports 4650G natively without any bios update which i can confirm. That's exactly what I was looking for. So I ordered the rest of the parts through MDComputers itself. I couldn't find a reasonably priced 8Gb 4000Mhz x2 ram on any other site and I also brought a 650W power supply and a cabinet along with it. I know, 650W is overkill, but I plan to drop in a 3070 or 3060 Ti as soon as I can get my hands on one. The Vega 7 iGPU on the 4650G greatly benefits from ram modules running at higher frequency, so i advise not to cheap out on ram. 8 Gb 3200Mhz x2 is good enough.

MDComputers quickly processed my order and had it shipped. All of the components arrived at my house in Kerala within one week. The processor came sandwiched in-between foam, taped on top of the stock AMD cooler. I was lucky my brother didn't throw away the foam thinking it was extra packaging. lol So be careful about that. I quickly put the CPU in the socket, attached the cooler, put the ram and m.2 SSD in, setup the case and voila, I was running the pc in less than an hour. I quickly installed CSGO and Genshin Impact.  I attached a new MSI Optix G241 monitor to the build and was surprised to know that the HDMI port integrated into the motherboard supports both 144Hz and FreeSync at the same time!! And wow, I got 170fps on the ulletical csgo fps benchmark at 1080p and a smooth 60fps on Genshin at medium settings. I couldn't believe my eyes. This is literally running on an iGPU. I was really impressed. I'll still buy a GPU when the prices come down as I wanna play more games. But right now, this is the best stopgap solution in my opinion. Used market is overpriced with the additional anxiety whether the product will work etc, new GPUs are unavailable to purchase etc etc.

Edit1: Disabling TSME in BIOS settings will give a performance boost of \~10% fps in games. It's some sort of enterprise security firmware for AMD, the ""PRO"" part of the cpu.

Also, changing the ""UMA Frame buffer size"" in ""Advanced/NB Configuration'' from ""Auto"" (512mb) to ""2G"" will increase the VRAM allocated to the iGPU from 512mb to 2GB. Absolutely do this if you have 16GB ram. It will smoothen out some frame drops in games.

I was playing csgo fine till one day when it started stuttering. I thought I was done for, that i made a mistake purchasing this APU, but after a bit of troubleshooting using the included Radeon software, I realised that the iGPU has saturated the 512mb of VRAM and was causing stutters. By some god's grace, techquickie youtube channel released a video on VRAM that day and it literally told me how to ""Increase VRAM on your system"" lol.

TLDR: Took a risk and bought an OEM iGPU in 2021 and i am happy, considering the current situation.

New driver release error - (Display driver amdwddmg stopped responding and has successfully recovered.)

Older driver release error - (Display driver amdkmdag stopped responding and has successfully recovered.)

The screen freezes for around 5 seconds, black screens for 5-10 seconds and then straight to desktop.

One thing I've just noticed is that when the driver crashes it's reported that the card hits 99% usage and the memory clock (Which is always stuck at 1750) hits 200-400. Is this just something that happens when the driver crashes or is it the cause? Can't find anything online so thought I'd ask here. -- [

I've tried reseating the card, ram etc... Got a new display port cable, checked all connections, two separate pcie cables for the gpu, changed the Tdr time, disabled ULPS, DDU and AMD Cleanup Utility every driver release, clean windows install, driver only install, updated bios, lowered the memory clocks, undervolting/underclocking, overclocking and pumping the voltage to max, temps while playing never exceed 85c, ran tests on the ram.

Switching to an nVidia GPU was a very positive experience with quick driver updates and no crashes.

The chipset issues are harder to pin down but I occasionally feel like the PC just becomes randomly unstable with some random delays in Windows 10, frustrating USB device disconnects, and occasional random reboots when waking from sleep. I dont remember struggling with this on Intel platforms. I really appreciate the value AMD has brought forth on it's AM4 platform and I am enthusiastic about supporting them. But it took almost a year before 5700XT drivers became stable and it's taking even longer for them to resolve everyone's issues with X570 chipset.

1,20,0,1,0,"Any tweaking tools for AMD Bristol Ridge/Carrizo CPUs? I have this Biostar A10N-9830E and its something very interesting being a Bristol Ridge part released in 2020. Uses a mobile FX 9830p CPU that's soldered onto the motherboard. [

Since its on Excavator architecture pre-Ryzen, its obviously pretty damn slow but the R7 graphics surprisingly performs decently and I wanted to use this as an HTPC or a cheap gaming PC. Especially because it costed me something like $85 for the whole thing.

 [Nero10578\`s 3DMark - Fire Strike score: 2019 marks with a Radeon R7 Graphics Mobile (Bristol, 512 Shaders) (hwbot.org)]( 

However, it seems like the CPU doesn't actually boost properly for some reason. The specs says it should boost to 3.7GHz and in this case it even has a 3.8GHz boost that it hits in light loads, but on full load it just locks to 3.2GHz.  
I know boost is an up to spec and usually for single threaded workloads, but considering this is not in a space confined laptop I think Biostar just sets a too low TDP value or something. Because the Asus FX550IU laptop that had this same CPU can boost to 3.5GHz all core speed.

So the result is as you can see abysmal CPU performance lol since its only at 3.2GHz.  [Nero10578\`s Cinebench - R15 with BenchMate score: 282 cb with a FX-9830P (hwbot.org)]( 

Is there a tool that can be used to tweak the performance of this CPU? Like Ryzen Master or 1usmus CTR for Ryzen. Or the AMD APU tuning utility for Ryzen APUs. I found AMDmsrtweaker but it doesn't seem to do anything. Sure I can change the P states voltages and clocks for the boost P0-2 states but it just still throttles back to 3.2GHz on full load.

If not can someone help mod the bios to make available the hidden settings or change the TDP setting to the max 45W supported by the APU? I will really appreciate it. The stock BIOS literally has nothing that's changeable in terms of performance tweaking except for disabling CPB and memory voltage and speed settings.

The bios for the motherboard is on the website here: [

I tried posting on the win-raid bios request forums as well since I am not sure how to BIOS mod this myself with the guides there as this is an uncommon platform. I would be willing to pay for anyone able to help with this as well as long as its a reasonable amount.

Despite GPU companies pushing 1440p and 4k cards, 1080p (1920 x 1080) still remains the resolution of choice for a vast majority of gamers, even in 2021.

Unfortunately since this card launched a couple months before the start of the pandemic it was pretty much impossible to buy. It's MSRP is below $275 yet people are selling it between $600 and $1100 (which is just depressing).

My daughter has been begging me to upgrade my system so she can get get it. My old card is a Vega 64 and even though getting 5600XT would technically be a downgrade, the 5600XT comes within 2% of the Vega 64 and in some games it actually outperforms it (1080p). In the future I want to focus more on 1080p gaming anyways (with high refresh rate monitors) because anything above that started to get too costly for me.

1,45,0,1,0,"AMD RX6000XT low GPU usage, clock speed, and FPS in older games. Are AMD acknowledging and working on a resolution?I am having, as many have been, issues with my new RX6000 series card.

Whereby some older games don't seem to be detected as a 3D application, and the system is not assigning GPU resource to that application, and the GPU is not clocking up. 

As an example, Minecraft with shaders, and Fallout New Vegas. When playing either game, the GPU only runs at 500MHz, and around 20% usage, resulting in worse performance than, for example, an old R9 290X.

Sometimes the FPS briefly spikes to the few hundred FPS heights I expect to see, when loading another 3D application or opening a piece of software that spikes the GPU utilisation and clock speed, it then dips and returns to being practically unplayable again. This tells me that it should be an easy fix.

Are AMD aware of an issue and planning to fix this? Or am I getting rid of this GPU and looking out for an NVIDIA alternative?  


\[This is an actual issue, Gigabyte even released a new BIOS for one of their GPU's to help alleviate some of the symptoms. However, to appease some folks, I have a good PSU, power connectors are not daisy chained, I have run DDU, I have tried various driver versions, I have tried reinstalling games, and even the operating system.

When I update the AMD driver from 21.3.1 to anything above that, the screen goes completely grey at the Windows login screen, then the monitor shuts off.

If I set the monitor to DSC 1.2 and hard reboot, I can see windows again, albeit at 60Hz.

1,28,0,1,0,"Getting the most out of a 6900xt in a nzxt H210Hello, I like to live dangerously and put gpus into cases they don't belong it. Overall not a terrible experience. Just wanted to ask for some recommendations to keep this fat boi as cool as this little case will allow.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no extra cooling apparatus besides the stock fans that come with the case, the cpu is a ryzen 7 3700x with the stock wraith rgb cooler. I would like to lower my gpu temps by about 10 degrees overall if possible. Running cpu intensive games like overwatch only gets the gpu to the 70s or low 80s which I am fine with as I don't play for long durations, however i tried to play metro exodus with ray tracing and wow I got to 95 degrees almost instantly. So heres the few questions I have

&amp;#x200B;

1) Would getting a liquid cpu cooler give the gpu more room to breathe temp wise?

2) Is the 6900xt locking to 500mhz in certain games related to the temps or just an amd bug? (For example overwatch with go well past 2000mhz but a game like intruder will not go over 500mhz ever its locked to it somehow and changing the clock speeds manually in radeon does nothing.

3)  Any other possible ways to bring temps down without buying a mid-ATX case. I understand the biggest culprit of the heat is the psu directly below the gpu choking it to a degree in more intensive games, I don't think this will be able to be remedied entirely of course, but if it can be mitigated by 15-20% I'll be more than happy.

If not no big deal, I just need a new mid atx mobo and a h510 case and all will be remedied.",getting xt nzxt h hello like live dangerously put gpus case belong overall terrible experience wanted ask recommendation keep fat boi cool little case allow x b extra cooling apparatus besides stock fan come case cpu ryzen x stock wraith rgb cooler like lower gpu temp degree overall possible running cpu intensive game like overwatch get gpu low fine play long duration however tried play metro exodus ray tracing wow got degree almost instantly here question x b getting liquid cpu cooler give gpu room breathe temp wise xt locking mhz certain game related temp amd bug example overwatch go well past mhz game like intruder go mhz ever locked somehow changing clock speed manually radeon nothing possible way bring temp without buying mid atx case understand biggest culprit heat psu directly gpu choking degree intensive game think able remedied entirely course mitigated happy big deal need mid atx mobo h case remedied

1,27,0,1,0,"Is the 5900x really just that hot?So I built a new rig 2 months ago. 5900x, 3080ti. Using an h150i for cooling (I am aware that High end air coolers are better FWIW, but I wanted the clean look). Anyway, I was shocked that my 5900x was Idling at \~59c. I figured it might be bad contact due to the weird AM4 mounting method, so I re-mounted and swapped paste for cryonaut (Expensive stuff but figured I might as well). it DID bring temps down a bit... but not much. Idle is like 55.5, touching the mouse pushes it to 60. That said, under load it seems to stay in the mid 70s most of the time so its not throttling. Just curious if that high of an idle is normal. The CPU it replaced, a 7700k, idled in the low 30s most of the time, and my old 4790k idled at 28.

1,10,0,1,0,"R9 280 vs WX 4100 for four display setup (2x4K, 2x1080p)?I'm building a new PC and am looking for an AMD GPU. I have two 4K monitors next to each other, than two 1080p monitors on top of the 4K ones. Currently I have an Nvidia NVS 510 which only has 2GB of DDR3, and apparently this setup is rather close to the bandwidth limit of the DDR3 which is likely why it stutters sometimes. And the drivers for the NVS 510 suck as I'm on linux.

I was initially looking at buying two WX 3100s or a WX 4100. But the BAPC Discord instead suggested an R9 280, one with two mini DP ports, a HDMI, and DVI port.

But now I have found a WX 4100 for £110-120, vs £90 for the R9 280. Originally the WX 4100 was £160 when bapc suggested the R9 280.

Question is what would you guys suggest? What extra features would I get with the WX 4100, do you think the price increase is worth it? The only advantage I could see is that I could upgrade the 1080p monitors to 4K if I ever wanted to (although I don't plan to).

Are there other advantages? I also have an interest in GPGPU and I imagine the WX 4100 would be better for that?

1,58,0,1,0,"HDMI / Display Port Cables Can Cause Your GPU To Appear Dead / BrickedHey, felt the need to offer a small PSA. 

I have just had a hell of a time dealing with an incredibly stupid and specific issue. A perfectly normal-looking HDMI cable was causing my 6800 XT to produce black screens after bios, but would function in Safe mode and Bios correctly.

This normally points to a dead video card, however, through hours of testing everything from a riser to pcie slots to OCs, vbios flashes, More Power Tool, Soft Power Play Tables, power connectors, PSU, motherboard bios configuration, and completely disassembling and reassembling my entire PC.. that a f\*\*\*ing HDMI cable short, on an undamaged perfectly normal looking HDMI, was causing my GPU to bootloop once I logged into Windows. So, PC is stable, GPU bootloops, evidenced through fan RPM responses and the RGB led radeon logo turning off then back on again.

HDMI / DISPLAY PORT CABLES CAN RARELY CAUSE COMPONENTS TO APPEAR TO BE FAILING.

This is probably obvious to most people, \*but it can be extremely confusing if it only fails some of the time.\*

In my instance, both the Bios and Windows safe mode were working, which meant that the cables were functioning, or at least, not f\*\*\*ing up other components, at least some of the time, hence why it was such a late thing that I tried.

Anyway. Hope this helps someone else, Thought I bricked my midnight edition and had a slightly emotional few hours resetting and reassembling a PC.

Cheers, hope I help save some people's time. &lt;3",hdmi display port cable cause gpu appear dead brickedhey felt need offer small psa hell time dealing incredibly stupid specific issue perfectly normal looking hdmi cable causing xt produce black screen bios function safe mode bios correctly normally point dead video card however hour testing everything riser pcie slot ocs vbios flash power tool soft power play table power connector psu motherboard bios configuration completely disassembling reassembling entire f ing hdmi cable short undamaged perfectly normal looking hdmi causing gpu bootloop logged window stable gpu bootloops evidenced fan rpm response rgb led radeon logo turning back hdmi display port cable rarely cause component appear failing probably obvious people extremely confusing fails time instance bios window safe mode working meant cable functioning least f ing component least time hence late thing tried anyway hope help someone else thought bricked midnight edition slightly emotional hour resetting reassembling cheer hope help save people time

So SupportAssist didn't update me to Adrenaline 2020 edition, so I went on AMDs website, used the auto detect and downloaded the newest drivers software.

Now everyday for the last four days, Radeon has given me the error code that the drivers/software don't match up. And have had to reinstall on a daily basis, although my 5900x is extremely fast, it doesn't take to long, but is very annoying having to wait for my shaders to download again.

I also get a weird code after turning my computer on after being off that my hardware has changed and should restart.

1,151,0,1,0,"Edge of Eternity Tech Q&amp;A – Midgar CEO on AMD FSR vs NVIDIA DLSS, PS5 vs XSX and MoreBy Alessio Palumbo / Jul 2, 2021 12:00 EDT from WCCF Tech, title of post is also the title of the article on that site.
Here are relevant parts for PC version of the game:

Edge of Eternity recently launched on PC, at long last, with console versions due later this year. Given that the game is one of only two (the other being Necromunda: Hired Gun) confirmed to support both NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR technologies, we thought it was a great time to once again chat with Midgar Studio CEO Jérémy Zeler-Maury, who also happens to be the game's lead programmer.


Can you compare the process of implementing AMD's FSR and NVIDIA's DLSS in Edge of Eternity? Which differences did you encounter?


Implementing DLSS was quite complex to integrate into Unity for a small studio like us; it required tweaking the engine and creating an external plugin to bridge Unity and DLSS. It was complicated, but in the end, it gave amazing results. FSR, on the other hand, was very easy to implement, it only took me a few hours, requiring only simple data. However, it did require the source data to be as sharp as possible since FSR is not a deep learning method and cannot reconstruct loss details. We needed to replace the built-in Unity TAA with the AMD Cauldron TAA (opensource) that we ported to Unity as it is a lot better at preserving details.


Quality-wise, do you feel there is a noticeable difference between the two in your game? Also, do you expect many other developers to implement both technologies in their titles?


Quality-wise, when there is a lot of pixel info available for upscaling to 4K, both technologies give amazing results, and I have a hard time seeing differences between them. I’d even say that I slightly prefer the FSR for 4K resolution since it doesn’t introduce any artifacts/minor blurriness that DLSS can sometimes introduce. For lower resolutions like upscaling to 1080p or 720p, I think DLSS gives a better result since it can reconstruct parts of missing details due to the nature of the technique. That said, I'm playing Edge of Eternity on a GPD Win3 (Intel APU), and using FSR to upscale to 720p gives a very similar result to native on a small screen like that and allows 60 FPS gameplay.

I think FSR being very easy to integrate means more games are going to get it, DLSS is more complicated to integrate. Aside from pre-integrated versions in engine (UE already has it and it’s coming to Unity but only for HDRP, whereas our integration is for the built-in pipeline) or AAA games, I don’t think many small developers will integrate it.


Back to the PC version of Edge of Eternity. Did you consider adding DirectX 12 support? Could this still happen post-launch, perhaps with some DX12 Ultimate features like ray tracing, sampler feedback, mesh shaders, or variable rate shading?


Unfortunately, the Unity DX12 implementation on the built-in pipeline is not solid enough. We have worse performance in DX12, and they made all the cool features available only for HDRP. Switching to this pipeline would basically require us redoing the project from scratch, so it’s very unlikely to happen.


Will you keep using the Unity engine for your next titles or consider switching to something else?


We’ll evaluate for the future depending on the project, but we’ll likely switch to Unreal Engine *5 in the future due to the open-source nature of the engine that allows us to modify it for our needs.",edge eternity tech q midgar ceo amd fsr v nvidia dl p v xsx moreby alessio palumbo jul edt wccf tech title post also title article site relevant part version game edge eternity recently launched long last console version due later year given game one two necromunda hired gun confirmed support nvidia dl amd fsr technology thought great time chat midgar studio ceo j r zeler maury also happens game lead programmer compare process implementing amd fsr nvidia dl edge eternity difference encounter implementing dl quite complex integrate unity small studio like u required tweaking engine creating external plugin bridge unity dl complicated end gave amazing result fsr hand easy implement took hour requiring simple data however require source data sharp possible since fsr deep learning method cannot reconstruct loss detail needed replace built unity taa amd cauldron taa opensource ported unity lot better preserving detail quality wise feel noticeable difference two game also expect many developer implement technology title quality wise lot pixel info available upscaling k technology give amazing result hard time seeing difference even say slightly prefer fsr k resolution since introduce artifact minor blurriness dl sometimes introduce lower resolution like upscaling p p think dl give better result since reconstruct part missing detail due nature technique said playing edge eternity gpd win intel apu using fsr upscale p give similar result native small screen like allows fps gameplay think fsr easy integrate mean game going get dl complicated integrate aside pre integrated version engine ue already coming unity hdrp whereas integration built pipeline aaa game think many small developer integrate back version edge eternity consider adding directx support could still happen post launch perhaps dx ultimate feature like ray tracing sampler feedback mesh shaders variable rate shading unfortunately unity dx implementation built pipeline solid enough worse performance dx made cool feature available hdrp switching pipeline basically require u redoing project scratch unlikely happen keep using unity engine next title consider switching something else evaluate future depending project likely switch unreal engine future due open source nature engine allows u modify need

You'd be losing a minimal amount of performance (just the overhead of enabling FSR) to have an image at *above native* quality. Most of the games that have FSR right now would benefit from this since they're quite easy to run, anyway. 

I know devs can do this if they want as there are several parameters for devs to tweak when implementing FSR in their games, but having it as a standard preset in the FSR framework would help for adoption.",anyone else want built fsr preset work x resolution scale factor love option without mucking around vsr fsr render game natively full resolution run edge reconstruction sharpening pas outputted frame losing minimal amount performance overhead enabling fsr image native quality game fsr right benefit since quite easy run anyway know devs want several parameter devs tweak implementing fsr game standard preset fsr framework help adoption

1,2,0,1,0,"Asrock x570 Phantom Gaming 4 bios update p4.10 Not sure if anyone else ran into this issue but thought I'd share what worked for me...

A while back, I updated my bios to p3.20 to prep myself if I ever upgraded to a 5000 series cpu because I read on reddit that a lot of builders will upgrade their cpu without updating their bios with their previous cpu, and then a lot of times they have to reinstall their previous cpu just to update their bios and then reinstall the new cpu - which can be a lot of unwanted work... unless you have an msi motherboard where you can just flash the bios with a usb and with the button on the motherboard.

Then I read somewhere on reddit that you should always update bios on motherboards because it fixes a lot of stability issues, etc. So I updated my bios to p4.10, but my pc kept getting stuck on the boot and I started panicking and reverting the bios back to previous versions. Every version I reverted back to, my pc would get stuck while booting maybe like 50% of the time... After 6-7 flashes of different bios, I remembered what happened back when I updated my bios to p3.20 (previous paragraph)... I read somewhere on reddit that asrock x570 boards ""support"" PCIE 4 but run into a lot of issues. A redditor in the post said to change the bios setting to PCIE 3 instead of auto or PCIE 4 and it should fix the issue. Had I remembered to do this again while updating my bios to p4.10, I wouldn't have spent an hour trying to flash my bios repeatedly to fix the booting issue thinking that it was a faulty bios update...

Long story short, if you're updating your bios on an asrock x570 mobo and then issues starting coming up like running into booting issues or maybe even other issues... try switching bios settings to PCIE 3 instead of auto or PCIE 4 and hopefully that'll fix your issue like it did for me!",asrock x phantom gaming bios update p sure anyone else ran issue thought share worked back updated bios p prep ever upgraded series cpu read reddit lot builder upgrade cpu without updating bios previous cpu lot time reinstall previous cpu update bios reinstall cpu lot unwanted work unless msi motherboard flash bios usb button motherboard read somewhere reddit always update bios motherboards fix lot stability issue etc updated bios p kept getting stuck boot started panicking reverting bios back previous version every version reverted back get stuck booting maybe like time flash different bios remembered happened back updated bios p previous paragraph read somewhere reddit asrock x board support pcie run lot issue redditor post said change bios setting pcie instead auto pcie fix issue remembered updating bios p spent hour trying flash bios repeatedly fix booting issue thinking faulty bios update long story short updating bios asrock x mobo issue starting coming like running booting issue maybe even issue try switching bios setting pcie instead auto pcie hopefully fix issue like

This results in high idle power usage (28W instead of 7W) and temps too and the fans ramping up every few mins - this is not ok. :|

The  reason I want to switch is because I have switched to a new rendering  program that uses NVIDIA primarily, which I don't have, so it uses my  CPU. I can't afford a new GPU rn but I can maybe swing a new CPU.

I  am a gamer but not an insanely heavy one. I play minecraft and second  life a lot (sl uses CPU also instead of GPU). The Sims sometimes. I  would like to play better games but I just haven't gotten to doing it  yet. The most intense ones I've played are Visage and Amnesia Rebirth or  whatever it was called.

1,23,0,1,0,"[Discussion] Can we talk about Ryzen CTR (Clock Tuner)? The Good, The Bad, The Fans, The Cautious. Let's hear your experience with it!A foreword - I am not a OCing expert. I have worked in IT/Project Management &amp; Product Management with a focus on user experience for 8 years, not micro electrical engineering or computer engineering. I am at best a enthusiast who can read. Take my opinion and my thoughts with a grain of salt. If you know better than me, enlighten me RESPECTFULLY. 

&amp;#x200B;

Into the meat:

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Ryzen CTR?** 

From [guru3d.com](

""*CTR (ClockTuner for Ryzen) software allows each user to customize the system with maximum energy efficiency. In this case, CTR is fully automated and does not limit the user in actions. The program has a kind of artificial intelligence, which will help in any situation, and the protection system will monitor each step so that your components were not exposed to danger. CTR is compatible with all motherboards on the AM4 socket, despite the artificial limitations of AMD. As for conditions, it is probably one thing - the processor should be based on ZEN2 and now ZEN3 architecture. CTR is made by Guru3D's oldtimer 1USMUS.*""

&amp;#x200B;

My easy explanation: It is a adaptive undervolting utility for Ryzen 2 and 3 CPUs that can also be used to OC to a limited degree via voltage increases. Created by [1usmus](

&amp;#x200B;

**Now why do I elude to it being a bit polarizing in the title?** 

The Negative:

Many people do not think its worth it or that it is more than anything ""snake oil"" (please for the love of god if you want to call it snake oil in the comments, at least provide some more information for others to see your claim) Going as far to identify that it can start running at a super high voltage that degrades your CPU over time. There is a great write up by [Chips and Cheese located here]( that goes into the details of their findings and concerns. 

The Positive: 

A high degree of the positive is recorded by the creator themselves (1usmus), anecdotal commenters across the webs who see performance or at least heat reduction, and article writers who have tried it themselves. Good reviews and writers have acknowledged the dangers and have warned about its downsides. Chris Cunningham wrote a great review/walkthrough of it on [LI Blog]( and of course [Linus did a video]( on it awhile back.

&amp;#x200B;

My uneducated Take:

I have tried CTR multiple times over updates since getting my 5950x. I have always had issues getting it to work. Back before RC5 2.1, I got it to work and saw temps reduced quite a bit but with that came a bit lower performance. This was before the new profiles and before I tuned it for more performance.

However, since RC5 2.1, I cannot get it to work. I do not blame the program itself, more the lack of documentation for anything other than ROG bios. I have an AORUS Master x570 pared with my 5950x and AORUS bios documentation and function is really REALLY bad. Like worse than ASRock was back in the late 2000s/early 2010s. I cant get settings to stick sometimes, there is no search function, there are settings that no-one seems to know when they overwrite the exact same settings other places. Its abysmal. The only reason I went with it was because it was the only board with 3 m.2s, 6 satas, and 8 fan headers with great VRMs. Anyway this isn't about AORUS its about CRT.   


I like the premise behind CRT but feel the lack of documentation, lack of User Guidance in app, throw off a lot of users who might even know a lot about PCs. Igors Lab has a great walk through that actually include AORUS documentation by skullbringer. (article Linked above)

&amp;#x200B;

Final thoughts:

I cannot express how much I appreciate 1usmus for creating this program. It takes time and research and A LOT of work. I do not want to overlook that or disrespect it. (and I ask you to do the same if you comment) I want to get this working and I want to better understand it.

**SPECS**

GPU: MSI RX 6800XT Gaming Trio

CPU Cooler: Cooler Master ML240 AIO

RAM: 4x 8GB Corsair Vengeance

Storage: 1TB PCIE 4.0 SSD

Ambient temperature: 21C (air conditioned)

My GPU temps are great. 35C at idle and 60+ when gaming on ultra. Airflow doesn't seem to be an issue.

However the 5800x runs at 50-55C at **IDLE** and 70C+ when gaming. In the first minute or so after boot up temperatures sometimes spike to 80C+. Latest driver and firmware updates installed. Everything is on stock settings. No OC. Power plan set to default (balanced). Reseated/repasted cooler but no improvement. I think thermal paste has been applied perfectly.

Since AMD is getting good yields and they're selling everything they're probably making a lot more 6900XTs than 6800s

The 6700xt has the highest availability.

The 6800 seems to be the least sought-after (probably because it's so rare and it runs pretty hot)

1,76,0,1,0,"Yet ANOTHER 5900x vs 5950x question, but from a slightly different perspectiveMost of the questions out here are ""will the 5950x get me more frames"" and I've absorbed all the advise there. The takeaway is that the difference won't be appreciable and most games are going to benefit from more cache per core since they aren't programmed to use all of the cores in the 5950x. Makes sense to me. 

My question is only slightly different, but seemed worth asking.

Use case &amp; goals:  
My primary use case getting the longest life possible out of the build for AAA 2k/4k gaming.  
For reference, I'm upgrading from a 6 or 7 year old coffee lake 8700k based system with a 1080 ti, so I'm hoping to build a system that will stay relevant around 5-7 years and maybe longer with a GPU upgrade in the 4-6 year timeline.

History:  
I built a full rig at microcenter just to get a 3080 ti (They reserve the cards for in store builds and I only paid 200 over msrp so I'm calling it a win). I figured I'd just go with sensible top shelf components to make the whole system last as long as possible. So I walked out with a MSI 3080 ti gaming trio, 5900x, and a MSI MAG x750. I had literally the worst install experience in my 30+ years of building systems, which I won't get in to because I need help with comparing components, not a place to vent. Anyway, I ended up with a system that won't post. The MSI board indicates that the CPU is the issue, and all of the other components work fine when tested in another rig. Microcenter is perfectly willing to exchange the CPU for me, but supply issues have left me without a CPU for this box for over a week. They are willing to let me exchange, but don't anticipate having more in stock any time soon.

There are no 5900x's in stock at any local microcenter stores, but there are 5800's in both of my closest locations and 5950's in stock at a different store within driving distance. The cost really doesn't matter to me as much as getting this build up and stable. It seems that, from a AAA game perspective, I won't see any realistic difference between the 5800, 5900x, and 5950x. 

Question:  
I haven't built an AMD based system since my Phenom II way back when, so I'm just a little out of my depth when attempting to make apples to apples comparisons. My end goal is to get the most value out of my system through longevity. I hope to skip the next gen of cpu's and video cards entirely, so I'm soliciting advise on what to purchase in place of the 5900x.",yet another x v x question slightly different perspectivemost question x get frame absorbed advise takeaway difference appreciable game going benefit cache per core since programmed use core x make sense question slightly different seemed worth asking use case goal primary use case getting longest life possible build aaa k k gaming reference upgrading year old coffee lake k based system ti hoping build system stay relevant around year maybe longer gpu upgrade year timeline history built full rig microcenter get ti reserve card store build paid msrp calling win figured go sensible top shelf component make whole system last long possible walked msi ti gaming trio x msi mag x literally worst install experience year building system get need help comparing component place vent anyway ended system post msi board indicates cpu issue component work fine tested another rig microcenter perfectly willing exchange cpu supply issue left without cpu box week willing let exchange anticipate stock time soon x stock local microcenter store closest location stock different store within driving distance cost really matter much getting build stable seems aaa game perspective see realistic difference x x question built amd based system since phenom ii way back little depth attempting make apple apple comparison end goal get value system longevity hope skip next gen cpu video card entirely soliciting advise purchase place x

1,5,0,1,0,"Had to RMA my 3900x, fingers crossedWarning, long story ahead!

Ever since I first built my system last March, I had noticed problems occasionally with random things: rebooting sometimes hung during initial motherboard post, random hard locks (everything just freezes on screen forcing a hard power cycle), could never really get PBO or any kind of memory clock adjustments to work or be stable, and random occasional bsod triggering a restart.

My system: x570 Aorus Elite, 64gb 3200 ram, Sapphire Nitro+ 5700xt, 3900x.

For a long time, I assumed many of these issues to be bios or gpu driver related issues. I also ran hyper-v virtualization, which means that Windows itself is technically running in a hypervisor at that point and not bare metal so I wrote off the PBO and memory clocking problems as an artifact of not running bare metal. 

My system only seemed stable if I kept memory clocks at the bios defaults of 2400mhz and any XMP profiles just caused instability-freezes, bsods, etc. In fact, I bought another pair of 16gb sticks hoping for an improvement but it never made a difference.

For the motherboard post issues, it started getting so bad I’d avoid shutting down or restarting unless absolutely necessary since it was starting to take me several hard power cycles before I could get it to finally post, and then there was the time I just let it sit and about 10 minutes later I heard it post finally.

Well, a couple of weeks ago my system just shut off randomly and I couldn’t get it to come back to life. I tried everything I could think of: new PSU, 2 different brand new motherboards, trying each ram module individually, clearing cmos multiple times, etc.

After the 2nd new motherboard wouldn’t post I came to the conclusion that the problem was the cpu. It was the last thing I’d ever thought would crap out on me, but all the various component testing confirmed it for me. So, as of today, my 3900x should be getting delivered to AMD in Miami, and I’ll just be waiting to find out what they decide to do.

In hindsight, now knowing that my cpu is bad, I’m fairly sure it may have been the culprit of many of those issues for the past year all along.  Certainly bios and driver updates fixed some of those problems, but the memory clocking and PBO problems specifically I could see being directly tied to a fault in the cpu, so I’m hoping that whatever replacement I get (whether via RMA from AMD or out of pocket) will result in a system that runs the way it always should have. 

I’ve loved this system and have really been impressed with the 3900x despite the issues, so I can only imagine how good it will be with a properly functioning cpu lol. 

Out of curiosity, has anyone else had to RMA their cpu, and if you have, what’s been your experience with the process?",rma x finger crossedwarning long story ahead ever since first built system last march noticed problem occasionally random thing rebooting sometimes hung initial motherboard post random hard lock everything freeze screen forcing hard power cycle could never really get pbo kind memory clock adjustment work stable random occasional bsod triggering restart system x aorus elite gb ram sapphire nitro xt x long time assumed many issue bios gpu driver related issue also ran hyper v virtualization mean window technically running hypervisor point bare metal wrote pbo memory clocking problem artifact running bare metal system seemed stable kept memory clock bios default mhz xmp profile caused instability freeze bsods etc fact bought another pair gb stick hoping improvement never made difference motherboard post issue started getting bad avoid shutting restarting unless absolutely necessary since starting take several hard power cycle could get finally post time let sit minute later heard post finally well couple week ago system shut randomly get come back life tried everything could think psu different brand motherboards trying ram module individually clearing cmos multiple time etc nd motherboard post came conclusion problem cpu last thing ever thought crap various component testing confirmed today x getting delivered amd miami waiting find decide hindsight knowing cpu bad fairly sure may culprit many issue past year along certainly bios driver update fixed problem memory clocking pbo problem specifically could see directly tied fault cpu hoping whatever replacement get whether via rma amd pocket result system run way always loved system really impressed x despite issue imagine good properly functioning cpu lol curiosity anyone else rma cpu experience process

1,47,0,1,0,"6800XT Time Spy Score - Excellent and Surprising - 20,986 Graphics ScoreI have a reference (AMD) 6800xt which I enjoy overclocking just to beat [time-spy]( scores. I [watercool]( on an Alphacool block, inside a LL 011d Mini. 2x360, 1x240. I came from a TT V71 which kept things a little bit cooler.

My original goal was to **break 20,000** \- which happened by about 3-400 points. *Stock on air was 17,710*. Watercooling alone bumped the score by 4-500. I started to get into the 20,5XX range. Not much changed when I went from a 3900x to a 5900x (PBO on). But just recently I got this new score which surprised me - I think the latest drivers improved GPU optimization. I updated because of FSR. Curious if anyone else saw this bump just by **updating drivers**.  I see that clock speed registered at 2710 which previously it would report 26XX. This may explain the jump in score; but not sure what made it increase.

Give my numbers a try:

Min 2620

Max 2720 (I may have increased by 10)

Max out power slider.

Fast Timing on VRAM

2130 (increasing/decreasing subtracted from results)

MPT to increase power, I think I got it set to 289/345? Wattage usage goes up to 330. Any decrease to voltage (below 1150) makes it unstable.

I am on 32GB 3200CL16, I stuck 3600CL16 sticks in there but it would crash and I didn't bother playing with the numbers since the RAM RGB couldn't sync to the mobo.

My current **goal is to break 21K**, which I am so close to and be in the top 100 for this GPU (which I currently am at #88) for graphics score. Anyone else have any tweaking tips?

Now i know all 5his its quite the oposite, besides a way more powerfull cpu the ryzen pro 4750g sports much more powerfull graphics.
This where not such a mistake if i where paying 150 buck for the 3400g cuz the 4750g pro sell oem at 300 bucks.
But due the lack of stock and dificulty to find a 3400g i en paying 230 bucks plus 19 bucks of shipping since i had to buy it in another contry, also i had to wait week and a half cuz the international shipping, todsy i saw thr 4750g pro at 299buck in a store in my countr with 24/48h free shipping. Just for 50 buck more i could had my hands on a 30% more powerfull gsming rig gpu wise and literally double the cpu power. I cant return to the shity store (alternate) cuz rhe say they will take 5 weeks in reinbursing me and i have to pay for rhe shipping still.
Also the fact that the 3400g is boxed and the 4750g pro oem its not an advantage but a waste of money sin the stock fan that came with the boxed version dont fit in desk mine small form factor and i already purchased a low profile but powerfull (4 heatpipes) heat spreader/fan for 50 bucks ( i was plaing in oc it a bit).
So, how stupid you ppl think i am?, and taking in mind that i have no laptop or destop sin my dell xps13 died i can live one more day wiout my linux terminal... Do you think i should return the 3400g and wait 5 weeks to buy a 4750g pro? Giving the fack its not avaliable to the public and the store that sells it can run out of stock?
I plan to use as budget workstation and low en daming rig and emulation rig.

**Main highlights**

---

* **Support For**

* DOOM Eternal™ next-gen update

* Vulkan® Ray Tracing

* **Added Vulkan® Support** 

* VK_EXT_custom_border_color

This extension allows applications to specify a custom border color for when the sampler address mode VK_SAMPLER_ADDRESS_MODE_CLAMP_TO_BORDER is used.

* VK_KHR_shader_subgroup_uniform_control_flow

This extension exposes the availability of the SPV_KHR_subgroup_uniform_control_flow SPIR-V extension for shader modules use. The SPIR-V extension provides stronger guarantees that diverged subgroups will reconverge.

* VK_EXT_color_write_enable

This extension allows applications to selectively enable and disable writes to output color attachments via a pipeline dynamic state. This has the potential to reduce pipeline counts for increased efficiency.

* **Fixed Issues**

* While playing MechWarrior 5™: Mercenaries on DirectX® 11, visual artifacts may be observed on some AMD Radeon graphics products such as Radeon RX 6000 series graphics products.

* An error message – Error 184 – may be received after running the AMD Auto-Detect and Install Updates utility program on Windows® 7 based systems.

* Adobe Substance 3D Painter™ may freeze while running this application on some AMD Radeon graphics products such as Radeon RX 6900.

However, there is currently a sale running for the 3800XT, which would be good enough for me, and would leave me not having to upgrade my MoBo.

My question is:

What's the downsides of using the 3800XT on the X370 MoBo, compared to if I was using say a B450 or B550? Do I get a noticeable performance hit?",performance hit x v series chipset xxx series ryzens hey still x mobo thinking upgrading b x however currently sale running xt good enough leave upgrade mobo question downside using xt x mobo compared using say b b get noticeable performance hit

1) do I need the extra cores? I will be gaming and streaming; do I need the extra cores? Does it really give me a benefit that I will use? Don't games only use 4 cores max?

2) is the 5800x harder to overclock ? I have heard good and bad things about this. I would feel more comfortable overclicking the 5800x over the 5900x due to price/risk ratio.

## Radeon Software Adrenalin 21.6.2 Highlights

## Support For

* DOOM Eternal™ next-gen update 	
   * Vulkan® Ray Tracing

## Added Vulkan® Support

* VK\_EXT\_custom\_border\_color 	
   * This extension allows applications to specify a custom border  color for when the sampler address mode  VK\_SAMPLER\_ADDRESS\_MODE\_CLAMP\_TO\_BORDER is used.
* VK\_KHR\_shader\_subgroup\_uniform\_control\_flow 	
   * This extension exposes the availability of the  SPV\_KHR\_subgroup\_uniform\_control\_flow SPIR-V extension for shader  modules use. The SPIR-V extension provides stronger guarantees that  diverged subgroups will reconverge.
* VK\_EXT\_color\_write\_enable 	
   * This extension allows applications to selectively enable and  disable writes to output color attachments via a pipeline dynamic state.  This has the potential to reduce pipeline counts for increased  efficiency.

## Fixed Issues

* While playing MechWarrior 5™: Mercenaries on DirectX® 11, visual  artifacts may be observed on some AMD Radeon graphics products such as  Radeon RX 6000 series graphics products.
* An error message – Error 184 – may be received after running the  AMD Auto-Detect and Install Updates utility program on Windows® 7 based  systems.
* Adobe Substance 3D Painter™ may freeze while running this  application on some AMD Radeon graphics products such as Radeon RX 6900.

## Known Issues

* Some users may experience elevated memory usage by AMD User  Experience Program. A temporary workaround is to opt-out of the AMD User  Experience Program. Learn more from AMD [here]( on how to opt out of the program.
* Resident Evil Village™ may experience an intermittent application  hang or TDR on AMD Radeon VII graphics products in the first mission of  the game.
* Enhanced Sync may cause a black screen to occur when enabled on  some games and system configurations. Any users who may be experiencing  issues with Enhanced Sync enabled should disable it as a temporary  workaround.
* Connecting two displays with large differences in  resolution/refresh rates may cause flickering on Radeon RX Vega series  graphics products.
* An Oculus service error may be received on Radeon RX 5000 &amp;  6000 series graphics products which prevents the Oculus Link setup  software from running.
* Radeon performance metrics and logging features may intermittently report extremely high and incorrect memory clock values.
* If Ryzen Master is not detected in Adrenalin software after installation, a system restart may be required.
* If Blue or Black screen is observed in mobile systems, temporarily disable Enhanced sign-in
* A driver mismatch error may appear when two versions of Radeon  software (Windows Store &amp; AMD Support versions) are installed on  your system. As a temporary workaround, launch the Windows Store version  of Radeon software.
* AMD is investigating an issue that may cause a small impact to battery life on AMD Ryzen 5000 notebooks.
* A Blue or Black screen may be observed after updating to the latest Radeon Software. A workaround is to disable core isolation.
* AMD is investigating a D3 code that may be seen in some motherboard after updating to the latest Radeon Software.
* Lower than expected performance may be observed on select AMD Athlon™ mobile systems.

## AMD Link for Windows Known Issues

* Intermittent grey frame corruption might be observed when  streaming with HEVC on certain configurations via an Internet  connection.

For the past couple of driver updates colors have been looking horrible and muddy. Mainly noticeable in browsers, the YouTube logo is orange and most icons are lifeless.

I tried installing older radeon drivers, 21.3, 20.12, 20.11, some of them worked still with shitty colors some of them wouldn't install and would show up as the newest ones. (I tried the newest-newest one too.)

1,2,0,1,0,"6900XT Random Screen FlickerSo I recently put together a new build. I had my RTX 2060 in it until upgrading to the 6900XT.

No issues what so ever with the 2060, but when I installed the 6900XT I noticed not always and not under load, but it would flicker briefly to a static screen and then back. Now sometimes it holds the static present for a few seconds, other times it is so quick the static never shows.

I’ve tried every troubleshooting step available including installing a clean version of windows 10 and downloading new drivers, bios, etc.,

So really I just want to know if this is happening for others, or if anyone could tell me what I’ve done wrong.

Cheers,
Rick

For a list of other requirements, such as Auto HDR and DirectStorage, please see [here](

The most important thing here, is Windows 11, at least the Insider Preview builds will *require* a UEFI system, with CSM disabled and they will require [TPM]( and [Secure Boot]( to be enabled, Windows 10 and previous Windows Operating Systems have not had such stringent requirements.

Most modern AMD and Intel motherboards have some form of Firmware based TPM, which is different to Hardware based TPM solutions.

The first step you will want to do is make sure you are running the latest BIOS for your system.

---

**If you are using an AMD platform**, look for something called AMD fTPM or something similar, this can generally be found under the 'Security', 'Trusted Computing' or 'Advanced CPU settings' in most BIOSes.

**If you are using an Intel platform**, look for something called Intel IPT/PPT (Platform Trust Technology) or something similar, this can generally be found under the 'Security', 'Trusted Computing' or 'Advanced CPU settings' in most BIOSes.

---

TPM options are generally found in the same location as Secure Boot.

When enabling Secure Boot, you may have to set the key mode to Standard instead of Custom, before you can enable Secure Boot

When back in Windows, you can use Windows Key + R and type ""tpm.msc"", if it looks something [like this]( you are in business.

To check whether Secure Boot is enabled, you can open Windows Defender and go to Device Security, if you see [this at the bottom]( it means you Secure Boot is enabled.

1,20,0,1,0,"My R7 260X fan died. Do all GPU fans have a standard connector?My GPU fan died last night so I'm out of a GPU right now. I can run it passively but I can't do any work. Just watching YouTube will overheat it and shut off my PC. So I disassembled it, cleaned it and I'm ready to repaste it but I still need a new fan.  
  
I looked up the fan ID and was able to find it on a Chinese website but the shipping will take approximately 1month. I don't want to wait that long so I'm looking for alternatives. I heard people will jerry-rig and attach fans with zipties. I'd still like to use the fan connector on the GPU so my question is; Can I plug in any GPU fan in there? Are the connectors standardized, or will only that specific model work with my GPU?

I picked up my new 6700 XT earlier in the week and am very pleased with my luck in binning - this reference model is able to hit 2.8 Ghz (actual clock, not in slider) stable at 1.11 V. Memory is at 2136 with fast timings.


My card came #1 in Fire Strike Extreme and Ultra Benchmarks, also only 3 other people beat me in time spy, and came #2 in port royal (had to downclock a bit to stay stable in port royal, sadly and I assume its a driver issue). 
These are all in comparison to other people with 2700X and 6700 XT. 

In Unigine Heaven, I got 105fps using 1440p extreme settings (vs. 93fps stock). I'm very happy to see this increase without the increase in temperatures thanks to undervolting.


I got one question, which is what should I do with the minimum clock slider? I don't like the idea of forcing my gpu to clock high when I don't need that power, but I'm curious if it will increase my benchmark scores. Any suggestions? 


Also any suggestions for how I could run Port royal at the clocks that are stable literally everywhere else?

1,12,0,1,0,"My PC shutdown yesterday for the first timeMy PC (Ryzen 3600 + RTX 2060) shutdown yesterday for the first time. Apparently it was because high CPU temperatures.

I installed a Video converter application (EaseFab Video Converter) to convert some MKV files and apparently that converter wasn't using my GPU at all to encode and my CPU was 99% all the time during the conversion. I put the files to convert then proceeded to watch some youtube. My PC shutdown after 1-2 minutes.

Fortunately it turned on again and I immediately opened CPU-Z and start the conversion again to see what's happening. As soon as I clicked the convert button, my CPU temperatures starter Ryze-ing (sorry I had to do it) like crazy! In a few seconds the CPU temp hit 105 °C ! I immediately paused the conversion to let it cool off, and searched what's the max temp for a Ryzen 3600 and apparently it's 95 °C   [ I didn't want to melt my CPU so I deleted that converter.

I'm using the stock cooler and never had any issues with it. The CPU temps never hit even 90 °C. I guess that converter application was completely destroying the CPU. I immediately started searching for another converter that uses the GPU to encode and fortunately I found one. First of all, it's muuuch faster and the CPU is not perma 99%.

Now my question is = yeah, the video converter application was bad, but is my cooler also bad that it couldn't keep up with that? Like it was reaching 105 °C in matters of 15 seconds. Aren't CPU/fans designed to cool on max load and/or slow down a bit if the temperatures reach critical limits?? Why wasn't the CPU lowering it's power to be safe, but instead it just went ham until it shutdown....?

but about a month ago I started having random black screens playing any game after a few minutes.

 pc remains responsive with audio output but a black screen and video signal loss. only a reboot worked, the issue only appeared playing games.

 I tried everything in the book to fix the issue:  DDU, Older drivers, Newer drivers, Windows updates, Only drivers and no adrenalin, removing any third-party software,  full windows reinstall, no sauce. 

The Cause:

Placing my new gen 3(crucial p5) m.2 on the gen 4 slot of my  MSI b550 tomahawk.

I did this because I was migrating my windows from an older P1.

after fiddling with everything I changed the m.2 and placed it on the gen 3 slot and the issue went away.

Does someone know how product warranty is handled if you overclock your gpu for a limited time? Specifically, I wanted to try out overclocking by adjusting core clock and power consumption, maybe vram, too (but without changing voltage).

If I tried this out and tested it for a couple weeks, then switch back to non-overclocked state, would my warranty still be valid? If then sometime later a hardware failure would occur (non-overclocked) could I still hope for support?

So far I always assumed it works like this: If I ever start using the card outside of its specifications, a “switch” is flipped internally and everything’s counting as overclocked from here on. But is this really the case? Maybe someone has any experience regarding this topic?",temporary overclocking warranty rx xt fe hi someone know product warranty handled overclock gpu limited time specifically wanted try overclocking adjusting core clock power consumption maybe vram without changing voltage tried tested couple week switch back non overclocked state warranty still valid sometime later hardware failure occur non overclocked could still hope support far always assumed work like ever start using card outside specification switch flipped internally everything counting overclocked really case maybe someone experience regarding topic

I'm going to finally update my CPU from current 6600k to 5600x. Choosing the CPU was the easiest part. Now I'm in the tough state of choosing a ""perfect"" motherboard for that. Other main specs are GTX 1070Ti and a 500W PSU (which I'm not willing to change right now)

Candidates:

At first I was totally sure about B550 and narrowed option to basically two motherboards

-Asus ROG Strix B550-F Gaming (Wi-Fi) - 156€ (currently on a discount until the end of a day. Usual price ~180€)

-GigaByte B550 Aorus Pro AC - 174€

And it's already a struggle to choose between them. My current board is Asus maximus and it's good, but i don't like the asus software. Second doubt about asus is vrm. However, at Hardware Unboxed temps are even better than gigabyte's

Then I started looking at X570. The reason is that in the future I'd like to get a second m2 ssd and i don't want to loose 2 sata ports, which is a usual thing with b550.

So, options here are:

-MSI MAG X570 Tomahawk WiFi - 210€

-GigaByte X570 Aorus Ultra - 233€

But that's already very expensive, especially gigabyte one. Unfortunately, there is no elite or pro with wifi in Europe. Also getting a x570 pro at 200 € doesn't make sense cause Bluetooth adapter will cost about 20-30€.

Psychologically it's very difficult to get an expensive mobo at a price almost equal to the price of cpu.

Which drives me to the idea do i really need those 2 sata ports? (Though currently I use all 6 of them)

I do plan to OC both cpu and ram, but nothing extreme.

What would you get on my place? Do i miss anything?
Appreciate any help and sorry for yet another ""mobo for 5600x"" thread",please help decide mobo x agony choise hello everyone going finally update cpu current k x choosing cpu easiest part tough state choosing perfect motherboard main spec gtx ti w psu willing change right candidate first totally sure b narrowed option basically two motherboards asus rog strix b f gaming wi fi currently discount end day usual price gigabyte b aorus pro ac already struggle choose current board asus maximus good like asus software second doubt asus vrm however hardware unboxed temp even better gigabyte started looking x reason future like get second ssd want loose sata port usual thing b option msi mag x tomahawk wifi gigabyte x aorus ultra already expensive especially gigabyte one unfortunately elite pro wifi europe also getting x pro make sense cause bluetooth adapter cost psychologically difficult get expensive mobo price almost equal price cpu drive idea really need sata port though currently use plan oc cpu ram nothing extreme get place miss anything appreciate help sorry yet another mobo x thread

1,31,0,1,0,"ASUS G15 Strix AMD Advantage Edition (Internal VS External) - basically, does a mux really matter much? I'd say...only a little and only in CPU bound situations.







So these results might seem strange. Using an external display, I guess allowed some more power to the CPU, because it wasn't being used for the iGPU? Graphics performance seems identical / within the margin of error. 

As you approach higher resolutions, 4K, 1440p, ect, it matters less. At this point, most games on the internal screen already run well over 150FPS @ 1080p. With the GPU mostly maxed out too. 

But how does this translate to 1080p, since this thing has a 300HZ screen, a little more CPU headroom would surely help, right? And yes, it does, a good bit at least in Strange Brigade. 



I want you to keep in mind, these results seem really good, and would argue in favor of a mux - that Strange Brigade is amazingly well optimized for a title. You can see many benchmarks out there showcasing the ability for say, a 3080 to play it at 4K360HZ with almost no frame dips.  Not a lot of games are that well optimized. 

Now I was in a rush and will do more benchmarks of some other games tomorrow, the other one I did is FFXIV Shadowbringers, which is a MMORPG&lt; but has a good gamut of CPU bound and GPU bound scenarios due to that.



Both were run at ""Maximum"" settings. 

Now, according to ASUS, a Mux switch would've made them have to redesign their entire layout, and additional parts would've added another 200-250$ to the price. We see in this Laptops that cost far more than it already and it matches their performance even without a mux.  So yes, maybe ASUS should sell an Advantage+ Edition with one or something, but I am more than happy for a laptop under 1500$ to provide this kind of performance.

And if you wanna bitch about the poor stock RAM it comes with, know that Lenuvo is also doing it in their ""Pro"" lineup, while costing significantly more.

Now, if you're using this as a portable, due to lack of mux, the battery life is incredible. I can get almost 2 hours of medium gaming loads on the battery, and with keeping the refresh at 300. If I go to 60, even more.

Watching movies / TV shows it could last me 7-8 hours...but I run it at 90-100% brightness, keep that in mind. I also use MadVR, so it's using more than most people would when watching media. 

And if you're using this as a Desktop replacement, then the lack of a Mux Switch literally doesn't matter and you just saved yourself some good money. :P",asus g strix amd advantage edition internal v external basically mux really matter much say little cpu bound situation result might seem strange using external display guess allowed power cpu used igpu graphic performance seems identical within margin error approach higher resolution k p ect matter le point game internal screen already run well fps p gpu mostly maxed translate p since thing hz screen little cpu headroom surely help right yes good bit least strange brigade want keep mind result seem really good argue favor mux strange brigade amazingly well optimized title see many benchmark showcasing ability say play k hz almost frame dip lot game well optimized rush benchmark game tomorrow one ffxiv shadowbringers mmorpg good gamut cpu bound gpu bound scenario due run maximum setting according asus mux switch made redesign entire layout additional part added another price see laptop cost far already match performance even without mux yes maybe asus sell advantage edition one something happy laptop provide kind performance wanna bitch poor stock ram come know lenuvo also pro lineup costing significantly using portable due lack mux battery life incredible get almost hour medium gaming load battery keeping refresh go even watching movie tv show could last hour run brightness keep mind also use madvr using people watching medium using desktop replacement lack mux switch literally matter saved good money p

On Kijijij ( our version of Craigslist). In the Scalpers market, the 6900xt is going for the same price as an RTX 3070. You can type 6900XT on kjiji and see for yourself. 

Give or take $100dollars CAD difference. But, in most cases, the 6900xt is around $1600 to 1700cad (probably i am sure Hashrate has something to do with it as well. ), the same scalper's price as an RTX 3070 triple fan. What's going on? The 6900xt is supposed to be on the same level as 3090? Is it because of DLSS? 

There is a youtube video about this, where a 3070 when DLSS is turned on, is on the same level as a 6900xt in FPS. Sometimes, being a little further ahead. 

I am no AMD or Nvidia fanboy, I just want the best bang for my buck. So my question is should I sell my 3070 in order to get the 6900xt for pretty much the same price? Or just stick with my 3070? 

On another quick note, the whole reason why I upgraded my PC is because of Red Dead 2, and DLSS is coming for this game.",xt price rtx going scalper market upgrade hi something odds happening lately north america canada kijijij version craigslist scalper market xt going price rtx type xt kjiji see give take dollar cad difference case xt around cad probably sure hashrate something well scalper price rtx triple fan going xt supposed level dl youtube video dl turned level xt fps sometimes little ahead amd nvidia fanboy want best bang buck question sell order get xt pretty much price stick another quick note whole reason upgraded red dead dl coming game

1,129,0,1,0,"More FSR / TAAU / DOF Testing with KingsHunt - Detailed IQ Testing with all FSR / TAAU levelsHello, I made [this post 2 days ago]( showing how Digital Foundries testing of KingsHunt was invalid.

Alex did reply, but sadly he didn't actually update the article images to include fixed ones with DOF properly disabled, since it is disabled on his TAAU screenshots which makes the game look much better as depth of field, even when disabled in options, blurs out the character, especially the lace dress.

I did make a mistake in my original post with the wrong scaling command for TAAU, which did make my resized TAAU incorrect (it was actually native rendering size) but the major bug being TAAU disables DOF was also validated when someone linked me to the developer of it on unreal forums: 

So big thank you to /u/TechTuts and /u/KeinZantezuken for that (and many others for their *overall* kind comments).

&gt;&gt;  Out of curiosity, will the new TAA upscaling behave well with depth of field? Currently when you set r.TemporalAA.Upsampling=1 , most of the DOF just disappears.

&gt; **So when r.TemporalAA.Upsampling=1, it basically forces r.DOF.Recombine.Quality=0 that looses the slight DOF convolution**, and that is due to DiaphragmDOF.cpp’s bSupportsSlightOutOfFocus. There needs to have some changes in the handling of the slight out of convolution (about 5pixels and below) when doing temporal upsampling that I didn’t have time to come down to. And we were only using temporal upsampling on current gen consoles. **Wasn’t a big deal back then because if your frame would need to be temporally upsampled, that probably meant you didn’t have the performance to run DOF’s slight out of focus**… However we exactly ran into this issue for our Lumen in the Land of Nanite demo running on PS5, but it is still prototype and I’m not sure whether I’m gonna have this finished by 4.26’s release. But yeah given how temporal upsampling is going to become important, it’s definitely something to fix very high on the priority list. 

So basically its expected bug because if someone was using upscaling, they don't want a perf hit from DOF, at least when initially designed.

Here are all of the images in one album: 

All screenshots are @ 3440x1440 with max settings except motion blur disabled and DOF disabled (though in game option doesn't actually disable it as you'll see).

Commands used:

```r.TemporalAA.Upsampling 1``` -- Enable TAAU - This disables FSR as well

```r.DepthOfFieldQuality 0``` -- Disable Depth of Field

```r.ScreenPercentage ###``` -- Set screen percentage. The game uses 77% for Ultra Quality, 67% for Quality, 58% for Balanced and 50% for Performance FSR modes (slider updates when you select). I used the same 4 + 100% for TAAU tests.

Setting | DOF ""Enabled"" | DOF Force Disabled
---|---|---|
Native |   | 
Ultra Quality FSR |  | 
Quality FSR |  | 
Balanced FSR |  | 
Performance FSR |  | 
TAAU 100% |  | 
TAAU 77% (Ultra Quality) | --- | 
TAAU 67% (Quality) | --- | 
TAAU 58% (Balanced) | --- | 
TAAU 50% (Performance) | --- | 

I didn't do all the TAAU w/DOF setting enabled since it doesn't make a difference when comparing 100% on vs off and would have just taken more time. As you can see there is no performance difference when disabling it vs disabling it for all other tests. I'd also bumped the mouse and had to re-position it and its slightly off for the last few TAAU tests and the bonus tests.

And for a bonus I did renderScale 120 for FSR UQ and Native, I don't think it actually scaled properly but it did do the sharpening pass for FSR

120% FSR UQ: 

120% Native: 

From the performance being basically equal (it fluctuates few fps) I don't think the ""UQ"" part of FSR was applied at all, which would have scaled it down to 92% or so, so would want to test that in the future with a 100% FSR vs 100% Native as well. I'm glad games like DOTA are allowing users to pick the exact scaling values, excited to see more games integrate that, and hopefully a sharpening slider as well.

Anyway, I hope this helps to clear up any misunderstandings from my first post. I had thrown in FSR / TAAU comparisons quickly but was mostly trying to point out that DOF was broken when TAAU was enabled. Unfortunately Digital Foundries while acknowledging that their testing was flawed, did not correct it, and even originally posted Godfall photos that were also flawed before people called them out on it on twitter. I hope Alex or someone else from Digital Foundries fully corrects the article with updated KingsHunt images and uploads a new video correcting it as well, DOF makes a massive difference in image quality in this game (no clue *why* the devs have the main character out of focus, their lace texture is ruined and it costs performance!).

Another note regarding performance, that would need to be tested for longer, as there is quite a swing in fps while just standing still, the fire/wall effect on the left side of the screen is likely the cause as it is what is changing the most. So while FPS is displayed, it would need to be captured for a while and averaged out to really compare performance between any of the modes as it did swing +- 5-10fps or so.",fsr taau dof testing kingshunt detailed iq testing fsr taau levelshello made post day ago showing digital foundry testing kingshunt invalid alex reply sadly actually update article image include fixed one dof properly disabled since disabled taau screenshots make game look much better depth field even disabled option blur character especially lace dress make mistake original post wrong scaling command taau make resized taau incorrect actually native rendering size major bug taau disables dof also validated someone linked developer unreal forum big thank u techtuts u keinzantezuken many others overall kind comment curiosity taa upscaling behave well depth field currently set r temporalaa upsampling dof disappears r temporalaa upsampling basically force r dof recombine quality loos slight dof convolution due diaphragmdof cpp bsupportsslightoutoffocus need change handling slight convolution pixel temporal upsampling time come using temporal upsampling current gen console big deal back frame need temporally upsampled probably meant performance run dof slight focus however exactly ran issue lumen land nanite demo running p still prototype sure whether gonna finished release yeah given temporal upsampling going become important definitely something fix high priority list basically expected bug someone using upscaling want perf hit dof least initially designed image one album screenshots x max setting except motion blur disabled dof disabled though game option actually disable see command used r temporalaa upsampling enable taau disables fsr well r depthoffieldquality disable depth field r screenpercentage set screen percentage game us ultra quality quality balanced performance fsr mode slider update select used taau test setting dof enabled dof force disabled native ultra quality fsr quality fsr balanced fsr performance fsr taau taau ultra quality taau quality taau balanced taau performance taau w dof setting enabled since make difference comparing v taken time see performance difference disabling v disabling test also bumped mouse position slightly last taau test bonus test bonus renderscale fsr uq native think actually scaled properly sharpening pas fsr fsr uq native performance basically equal fluctuates fps think uq part fsr applied scaled want test future fsr v native well glad game like dota allowing user pick exact scaling value excited see game integrate hopefully sharpening slider well anyway hope help clear misunderstanding first post thrown fsr taau comparison quickly mostly trying point dof broken taau enabled unfortunately digital foundry acknowledging testing flawed correct even originally posted godfall photo also flawed people called twitter hope alex someone else digital foundry fully corrects article updated kingshunt image uploads video correcting well dof make massive difference image quality game clue devs main character focus lace texture ruined cost performance another note regarding performance need tested longer quite swing fps standing still fire wall effect left side screen likely cause changing fps displayed need captured averaged really compare performance mode swing fps
1,28,0,1,0,"I'm very disappointed in AMD...I've an old HD7790 (R7-260X) which AMD recently axed, unfortunately. Well, I can't complain much (unlike R9 Fury owners) considering the card is (was) a rival of 650Ti; and in extension just a tad bit faster than the humble GT1030. 

My biggest concern is Windows 11 support on Adrenalin 21.5.2, the last driver update it'll ever receive. On the driver page it says: 

&gt;""*This product has been moved to a legacy support model and no additional driver releases are planned.*"".

Which practically means it's not going to get any support for Windows 11, despite native DirectX 12 support. Meanwhile Kepler, GCN 1-2.0's archrival, is most definitely going to receive an update for Windows 11 as it'll be axed later this year (October) but is seems like AMD users are **ROYALLY** screwed, especially R9 Fury owners?

What shady practice is this?

First, I'd to deal with the diminishing performance with each driver update and now I'll have to deal with this too?!

Plus there's this: 

&gt;*""For users passionate about gaming, you may wish to consider upgrading to a modern GPU and benefit from exciting new features, improved performance, lower power consumption and broader compatibility with the latest PC games. For information about current graphics products and where to buy, please visit:* *AMD Radeon™ RX Graphics Cards**.""*

D!ck move, AMD. I'd the option to choose either the 650Ti or HD7790 but I chose the later because of all the voltage and p-state tweaks AMD offers (I love to play around with voltages) + the card **natively** supports DirectX 12 which was a huge deal in the early 2010s but now I'm starting to regret my decision.

Given that the new consoles have processors nearly equivalent to a 3700x, would 8 cores and 16 threads be optimal for the future? I know that the previous gen had 8 cores also, but quad core Intel CPUs could out do the shitty Jaguars. I feel like having decent 8 core CPUs now may lead to proper optimisation for all of said cores in future games.

Which is why I’m worried about buying the faster CPU with less cores. Im not sure if that’s going to be a viable strategy moving forward.

For reference I’m looking at pairing with a 6700xt.

1,23,0,1,0,"The economic incentive of FidelityFX Super Resolution adoption in older games without microtransactions.Hello,

(this is my first post in Reddit)

&amp;#x200B;

The release of FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) is certainly great news for gamers, as the compatibility with older gpus reveal itself far more wide than what AMD has claimed in the beginning. This may have to be with some point of diminishing returns as Frank Azor stated in an interview  with The Full Nerd. Anyway, it remains to be seen where the limit of adoption will finally land, but this open a new question regarding the incorporation of the technology in older games. There is a good amount of great, not so old games, that could potentially benefit with the adoption of FSR, and that now could be played (or played at higher resolutions/details) in lower end hardware. I'm thinking in The Witcher 3, Doom 2016, Wolfenstein The New Order, just for naming a few. The question is, would the current selling price of this games be enough incentive to developers to adopt FSR, in older games that lack of microtransactions? If is not, the owners of older hardware could be missing a great opportunity for playing again (or playing for the first time) these games. There are two possible solutions I can think right now (my background is in economics):

1) The adoption comes in the form of an expansion for the game that you can buy. This would be the ""market solution"".

&amp;#x200B;

2) The adoption comes as the community request to developers that certain games be included, this giving the signal to them that there is hidden demand for it. Although is still a market solution, it has more community elements and adds no new costs.

 

All of this also has to do with the poll AMD made, requesting gamers to reveal their preferences. **The publication of the results could be a toll for the community** in the second solution proposed. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for me, I game in Linux... but, how knows when fate could surprise you.

&amp;#x200B;

That's all.

1,5,0,1,0,"Overclocking - 5950x - Ryzen Master EDC limit somehow better than BIOSHi everyone, I discovered something super weird today when attempting to do a bit of overclocking. If I run Cinebench R23 with just PBO enabled in my BIOS and everything else stock my Cinebench score floats between 27.5k to 28k. The PBO enabling gives me the following - 140A TDC and 215A EDC. However when I drop my EDC on Ryzen Master to 150A I can get a Cinebench score of 28.5k. 

So naturally I went to the BIOS to set the EDC to 150A and TDC to 140A manually so I wouldn't have to use Ryzen Master every time. However now my TDC only hits about 92% (i.e it doesn't hit 140A TDC anymore) and I end up with a Cinebench score of about 24k. It's definitely not my PPT that's a problem.

So for some reason I need to set the 140A TDC and 150A EDC limit on Ryzen Master to get that performance boost.

Has anyone experienced something this weird with Ryzen Master? I'm left with two choices - enable just PBO and move on with life, or always use Ryzen Master on startup to get that extra 2% (probably will drive me nuts long term).",overclocking x ryzen master edc limit somehow better bioshi everyone discovered something super weird today attempting bit overclocking run cinebench r pbo enabled bios everything else stock cinebench score float k k pbo enabling give following tdc edc however drop edc ryzen master get cinebench score k naturally went bios set edc tdc manually use ryzen master every time however tdc hit e hit tdc anymore end cinebench score k definitely ppt problem reason need set tdc edc limit ryzen master get performance boost anyone experienced something weird ryzen master left two choice enable pbo move life always use ryzen master startup get extra probably drive nut long term

1,337,0,1,0,"Windows 11 Megathread - Is my system compatible, TPM, Secure Boot and moreEarlier today, [Microsoft announced Windows 11]( it brings many new features, such as Auto HDR, DirectStorage, as well as a UI overhaul.

Please use this thread to ask whether your system is compatible, for dedicated Windows 11 discussion, please use /r/Windows11

Windows 11 will be coming to Windows Insiders on the Dev ring sometime next week and will be releasing to everyone else later in the year.

Here are the system requirements for Windows 11

---

* **Processor:** 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster with 2 or more cores on a compatible 64-bit processor or System on a Chip (SoC)

* **RAM:** 4 gigabyte (GB)

* **Storage:** 64 GB or larger storage device

* **System firmware:** UEFI, Secure Boot capable

* **TPM:** Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 2.0

* **Graphics card:** Compatible with DirectX 12 or later with WDDM 2.0 driver

* **Display:** High definition (720p) display that is greater than 9” diagonally, 8 bits per color channel

* **Internet connection and Microsoft accounts:** Windows 11 Home and Windows 11 in S mode now require an internet connection during setup and require the use of a Microsoft Account, no more local (offline) accounts

---

For a list of other requirements, such as Auto HDR and DirectStorage, please see [here](

The most important thing here, is Windows 11, at least the Insider Preview builds will *require* a UEFI system, with CSM disabled and they will require TPM and Secure Boot to be enabled, Windows 10 and previous Windows Operating Systems have not had such stringent requirements.

Most modern AMD and Intel motherboards have some form of Firmware based TPM, which is different to Hardware based TPM solutions.

The first step you will want to do is make sure you are running the latest BIOS for your system.

If you are using an AMD platform, look for something called AMD fTPM or something similar, this can generally be found under the 'Security', 'Trusted Computing' or 'Advanced CPU settings' in most BIOSes.

If you are using an Intel platform, look for something called Intel IPT/PPT or something similar, this can generally be found under the 'Security', 'Trusted Computing' or 'Advanced CPU settings' in most BIOSes.

TPM options are generally found in the same location as Secure Boot.

When enabling Secure Boot, you may have to set the key mode to Standard instead of Custom, before you can enable Secure Boot

When back in Windows, you can use Windows Key + R and type ""tpm.msc"", if it looks something [like this]( you are in business.

To check whether Secure Boot is enabled, you can open Windows Defender and go to Device Security, if you see [this at the bottom]( it means you Secure Boot is enabled.

1,22,0,1,0,"Hey AMD, just for the record, some of us would really dig it if you could use FSR for dynamic downsampling when we have performance headroom.FSR is a *performance enhancer,* basically, we trade a bit of visual fidelity, in the form of resolution, in exchange for a few more frames per second, and I totally dig that, because I have a hard time capping out my framerate these days.  (Vega 64, 1440p@144hz, by the way.)  
  
But some people have absolutely *beastly* systems, stuff that can hit that 120hz or 144hz or 240hz mark with ease, and for those folks, it seems to me, FSR could be used as an *image enhancement* feature.  

Stick with me here:  FSR says ""Okay, this game is playing at 30fps@100% resolution scaling, so let's turn the resolution scaling down to 75% and bump the fps up to 50fps.""  What if it could *also* say ""Okay, this game is playing at 144fps@100% resolution, so let's turn the resolution scaling *up* to 115%, and reduce the fps by nothing.""  
  
See what I'm getting at?  
  
I mean obviously right now AMD should be focused on maximizing performance, since that the *whole point* of FSR, I'm just saying that someday, AMD, if you get the time, a lot of us would really dig having an option for dynamic super sampling/resolution.  
  
Some games don't take a ton of horsepower to run, so AMD should use that extra performance headroom for image enhancements.  Anyone else with me?  Does that sound like a feature that you'd like to have, or maybe actually use, if it was well implemented?",hey amd record u really dig could use fsr dynamic downsampling performance headroom fsr performance enhancer basically trade bit visual fidelity form resolution exchange frame per second totally dig hard time capping framerate day vega p hz way people absolutely beastly system stuff hit hz hz hz mark ease folk seems fsr could used image enhancement feature stick fsr say okay game playing fps resolution scaling let turn resolution scaling bump fps fps could also say okay game playing fps resolution let turn resolution scaling reduce fps nothing see getting mean obviously right amd focused maximizing performance since whole point fsr saying someday amd get time lot u really dig option dynamic super sampling resolution game take ton horsepower run amd use extra performance headroom image enhancement anyone else sound like feature like maybe actually use well implemented

I grabbed 2 sticks from that build and tossed them into my new ITX board and completed the build. After booting and installing drivers and stuff, my 6900xt would randomly black screen, or the driver would crash mid game.

I knew it wasn't the card because it worked fine in my last build. The old psu was a 750 watt and the new one was 850 watts; so I knew it wasn't the PSU. So had to be something else.

I remembered reading about all the black screen problems people were having and remembered most people saying it was RAM compatibility problems and sure enough it turned out to be that I had mixed the kits together.

So despite these sticks being the exact same brand, frequency and timing, they caused all sorts of issues with the card. Goes to show that a lot of these driver problems can definitely be due to RAM instability. Nvidia drivers must be far more error tolerant, or maybe it can be said that AMD drivers are operating on a knife's edge in terms of optimizing and error recovery.",able reproduced random black screen issue none beforei recently transferred small form factor case stick crucial gb ballistix mhz ram installed old system kit bought separately grabbed stick build tossed itx board completed build booting installing driver stuff xt randomly black screen driver crash mid game knew card worked fine last build old psu watt one watt knew psu something else remembered reading black screen problem people remembered people saying ram compatibility problem sure enough turned mixed kit together despite stick exact brand frequency timing caused sort issue card go show lot driver problem definitely due ram instability nvidia driver must far error tolerant maybe said amd driver operating knife edge term optimizing error recovery

I also see 6900 XTs for  £1700 but thats way too over the MRSP which is supposed to be around  £1000+. 

I am tending towards getting a Radeon (I currently have a 1080Ti) as I don't want to spend well over a grand for a graphics card having been pondering over it for a while.

Comes 2015, i decided to buy my first gaming desktop PC and of course it was Nvidia and Intel components, back the  AMD didn't release Zen CPU or the 400 Radeon series

2020,before the price of GPUs go any higher i rushed to get me a new PC just in time and this time i went from an I7 6700K, geforce 970, to a Ryzen 7 5800X and a radeon 6900XT(Heat in of the moments, would've settled with 6800XT instead but that mean an Nvidia GPU would've been better at the same pricetag).

I was faced with multiple problems:-

-RAM was not the right type(shopkeeper fault, got a free replacement of 48GB which is Neat i guess).
-mobo Bios was Kaput causing multiple problem untill it was reinstalled(shopkeeper installed initially).
-Steam software Screenshot folder is a mess, no photo is in an Assign folder
-AMD adrenaline has been causing me multiple problem including my media folder is not well organised like my Geforce experiance folder.

I became the pioneer among my friends and family to try AMD hardware and so far the grass is not greener on the otherside.

1,466,0,1,0,"Digital Foundry made a critical mistake with their Kingshunt FSR Testing - TAAU apparently disables Depth of Field. Depth of Field causes the character model to look blurry even at Native settings (no upscaling)I noticed in the [written guide]( they put up that they had a picture of 4k Native, which looked just as blurry on the character's textures and lace as FSR upscaling from 1080p. So FSR wasn't the problem, and actually looked very close to Native.

Messing around with [Unreal Unlocker]( I enabled TAAU (```r.TemporalAA.Upsampling 1```) and immediately noticed that the whole character looked far better and the blur was removed.

Native: 

TAAU: 

I had already disabled Motion Blur and Depth of Field in the settings but the image still didn't look good with TAAU off.

I started playing with other effects such as ``` r.PostProcessAAQuality``` but it still looked blurry with TAAU disabled. I finally found that ```sg.PostProcessQuality 0``` made the image look so much better... which makes no sense because that is *disabling* all the post processing effects!

So one by one I started disabling effects, and ```r.DepthOfFieldQuality 0``` was the winner.. which was odd because I'd already disabled it in the settings.

So I restarted the game to make sure nothing else was conflicting and to reset all my console changes, double checked that DOF was disabled, yet clearly still making it look bad, and then did a quick few tests

Native (no changes from UUU): 

Native (```r.DepthOfFieldQuality 0```): 

FSR Ultra Quality (```r.DepthOfFieldQuality 0```): 

TAAU (```r.TemporalAA.Upsampling 1``` and ```r.SecondaryScreenPercentage.GameViewport 77```): 

As you can see, FSR Ultra Quality looks better than TAAU for the same FPS once you force disable DepthOfField, which TAAU is already doing (likely because its forced not directly integrated into the game).

But don't take my word for it, test it yourself. I've given all the tools and commands you need to do so.

Hopefully the devs will see this and make the DOF setting work properly, or at least make the character not effected by DOF because it really kills the quality of their work!

I'd like to upgrade to a 1440p monitor, but I wasn't sure if it was worth it with the performance loss. I'm only looking at image quality right now without looking at the difference between monitors. I realize that some of the image tech in current 1440p monitors might look better than my older 1080p panel, but I don't want to factor that in right now.

Running things at your monitors native resolution will always show a quality gain, and I'm curious if it's even worth upgrading. I tried ordering images from what I think looks best to worst. I'm a little bit torn. 

\-Ultra Quality FSR at 1440p is probably slightly better than a native 1080p image with Sharpening on a 1080p display, but I also ***loose*** roughly 5% performance.

\-Quality FSR at 1440p is comparable to 1080p with Sharpening on a 1080p display, and I ***gain*** around 5% FPS. The fact the 1080p Sharpened image is running natively on my display does sometimes kind of make it look a bit better in my opinion, but it's a tossup.

I would like to be able to manually tune Sharpening on top of FSR like shown in this previous post [

but until I get an AMD GPU again to force RIS in the control panel, I'm not so sure it's actually worth upgrading.

They use temporal upsampling which far out does FSR as discussed by digital foundry. New games like COD, Battlefield, Fortnite, Metro etc. will not benefit at all from FSR as they are already using a better method for upsampling. I'm excited to see FSR implemented in older/indie games that don't have access to more advanced temporal techniques but for the vast majority of modern AAA releases FSR serves no purpose.

&gt; ###How it works

&gt; FidelityFX Super Resolution is a spatial upscaler: it works by taking the current anti-aliased frame and upscaling it to display resolution without relying on other data such as frame history or motion vectors.

&gt; At the heart of FSR is a cutting-edge algorithm that detects and recreates high-resolution edges from the source image. Those high-resolution edges are a critical element required for turning the current frame into a “super resolution” image. 
FSR provides consistent upscaling quality regardless of whether the frame is in movement, which can provide quality advantages compared to other types of upscalers.

&gt; FSR is composed of two main passes:

&gt; * An upscaling pass called EASU (Edge-Adaptive Spatial Upsampling) that also performs edge reconstruction. In this pass the input frame is analyzed and the main part of the algorithm detects gradient reversals – essentially looking at how neighboring gradients differ – from a set of input pixels. The intensity of the gradient reversals defines the weights to apply to the reconstructed pixels at display resolution.

&gt; * A sharpening pass called RCAS (Robust Contrast-Adaptive Sharpening) that extracts pixel detail in the upscaled image.",amd fidelityfx super resolution page updated detail work high quality mb comparison detail render time taken m le etc work fidelityfx super resolution spatial upscaler work taking current anti aliased frame upscaling display resolution without relying data frame history motion vector heart fsr cutting edge algorithm detects recreates high resolution edge source image high resolution edge critical element required turning current frame super resolution image fsr provides consistent upscaling quality regardless whether frame movement provide quality advantage compared type upscalers fsr composed two main pass upscaling pas called easu edge adaptive spatial upsampling also performs edge reconstruction pas input frame analyzed main part algorithm detects gradient reversal essentially looking neighboring gradient differ set input pixel intensity gradient reversal defines weight apply reconstructed pixel display resolution sharpening pas called rcas robust contrast adaptive sharpening extract pixel detail upscaled image

How it it should be tested instead - compare image quality with different upscaling methods tested at same scene, at same or close enough fps. DF did something similar, but used gpu utilization at fixed 60 fps as metric (again imo - not a good way to do it). Here you can see some examples of FSR being superior to default upscaling at same fps:

He's been complaing to me that he keeps getting random lag spikes with really high cpu times and very low fps. So we hop in a discord and he screen shre3s with and shows his task manger and his i7 -9700f. Is running at 2.8ghz. I know base clock is 3.00, we'll get to that in a few. So must be a bios setting right.  Have him reboot and I go look up the manuall for his Asus Tuf H365m and there's nothing in the manual about what the bios has to offer. Just EzMode and Advanced...great. I know nothing.....nothing...about Intel. Been an AMD fanboy since I built a K62 in high school. So we stumbling through I find Turbo Boost Mode was disabled. He's had the pc for about a year now he got from IbuyPower...it's been disabled this whole time. He's not a very tech savy kid. He didn't even know about he bios. I believe IbuyPower set it that way to limit the power. They installed a aluminum tiny little cooler. It looks like an cheap intel one but off brand. It's way to small for a i7. So we get that on, back to Windows Task Mgr shows boost speeds...So he tries the game and she got right up to about 99 degrees when he pulled the plug. 

So I figured with that small cooler it just couldn't handle normal boost  settings. So messing around in Intel XTU. I tried playing wit hthe PL1, PL2, Turbo time. Nothing made a difference. The best I could do was drop the PL1 watts down pretty low that it Power limited. So I stumbled across ThrottleStop. Reset what I messed with in XTU and tried setting a voltage offset and dropping the boost clocks from 47 to 45 and lower for the other cores following the same pattern that was set. It works. Using the stress test in ThrottleStop. All cores boosted to 4.5 temps were down around 60-65c. Awesome.  So trying to tweak the settings back the other way to see if I could get the performance up just a bit the pc crashes...strange..so reset Throttlestop.ini and boot back into windows Im dumbfounded...my best guess that I could tell the kid is his cooolers just too weak. So for shits and giggles I have him go back in to the bios and I find a seeting Cpu Performance Enhancer in A.I Tweaker. I missed it in the first time in the bios. I look it up and come to find out it was set to auto and was overriding the max boost clocks and tyring to do an all core 4.7ghz  turbo boost. What the fuck. Disable that...Set the Turbo boost  settings all back to default. Fuck it.  fuck stressing it...Go right into MW. cpus sitting at 75c and he's estatic.

Between the terrible lack of information Asus provided about the bios, and Intel's odd way of trying to turbo boost and Asus's attempt at trying to oc. That was the worst experience I've ever had trying to diagnose some thing. I don't have proof that IbuyPower disabled Turbo Boost but it sure looks like it and that's a real scummy way of trying to sell performance while lowering cost's is sly sneaky ways.

For the past month I've been reading and watching everything that I could to understand what I can get to create a new setup for another at least 4 years (probably more) and at first I was thinking about going with Intel, then I thought maybe it would be better to wait for next gen + DDR5, but I feel that will be hella pricey and not that great at first so I finally decided that let's build a new PC this year and the more I've read about it the more it looked like that the AMD cpus are the better option. So, I'm 99% sure that I'll be buying AMD but I have a couple of questions, because the more I read it, the more my brain hurts.

* I'm planning to get 5600x because I only game and work as programmer so I don't the extra power of 5800x but I'm wrong here and it's bettee to get the 5800x? Especially if I'm planning to use this setup for another at least 4 years and you never know what thw future will bring, maybe I'll start to need that extra power from CPU?

* X570 or B550 - the same question that everyone have. At first I was planning to get X570 MSI Tomahawk (after watching JayzTwoCents video about that topic), but then I started to read more about it (on this subreddit too) and it looks like that people recommended to go with B550 but the posts that I've saw about it were from a couple of months ago, but maybe something changed about it since then? I'm using 2 SSD Sata drives, some time later on will add first m2 drive, and I would like to have a a space for an upgrade later on to add a second m2 drive.

* I've seen so many different opinions about getting a CPU cooler for 5600x that now I'm not sure what's the best thing to buy/do. Should I go with AIO, air or just stick with the stock cooler? 

* And just to be sure: I'm planning to get 850W PSU from Corsair (I think it's called 850x something something), will that be enough for 5600x and for the rest of components that I'll use for this setup (2x16GB 3600Mhz RAM, 2x sata drives, 1x m2 drive, RTX 3080 and CPU cooler of some sort)?",really thinking switching amd intel couple noob questionshey really old setup gtx still work think time build setup come past month reading watching everything could understand get create setup another least year probably first thinking going intel thought maybe better wait next gen ddr feel hella pricey great first finally decided let build year read looked like amd cpu better option sure buying amd couple question read brain hurt planning get x game work programmer extra power x wrong bettee get x especially planning use setup another least year never know thw future bring maybe start need extra power cpu x b question everyone first planning get x msi tomahawk watching jayztwocents video topic started read subreddit look like people recommended go b post saw couple month ago maybe something changed since using ssd sata drive time later add first drive like space upgrade later add second drive seen many different opinion getting cpu cooler x sure best thing buy go aio air stick stock cooler sure planning get w psu corsair think called x something something enough x rest component use setup x gb mhz ram x sata drive x drive rtx cpu cooler sort

I installed everything and it seems to be working properly except for the temperatures. I'm idling at around 55-60 doing nothing, under load it can go up to 65-70. Occasionally it'll go up as high during extreme load to 79 and hover there.

Changing fan to blast at 100% seems to not really do much to the temps itself as much as I am used to seeing so I'm starting to suspect the mounting kit to be bad. Before I order a new cooler, I wanted to see if it'd be a waste of money. I read people get 30's idling and I kind of want that as well.

I reapplied paste three times without any major changes to what's going on (Reapplied paste on my GPU as well and almost got 10 degree difference, so I wouldn't say my skills of paste application are lacking).

For people who want to try this out for themselves, here are some links if you don't know how to enable AMD VSR or Nvidia DSR:

Nvidia DSR: [ 

Essentially, you need to turn on VSR or DSR and then go to the in-game graphics settings and turn up the resolution beyond your native display resolution.

The Riftbreaker: Prologue Demo is also free Steam:

I think that using VSR or DSR is a pretty viable option for people that want to use FSR with 1080p monitors. While the performance uplift is not as much, it is way better than not using FSR at all. I will happily give away some of the 40% FPS uplift to get better image quality and still have better performance (29%) than native 1080p.

1,27,0,1,0,"Prefix's rundown of FSR vs DLSS differencesHere are my opinions on the differences between FSR vs DLSS

_________

Pros of DLSS  vs FSR
Handles TAA shimmering better than FSR  
Standing still images often look a bit better. And text on billboards actually looks fantastic


_____________

Cons of DLSS vs FSR

GPU support limited to RTX cards  
Moire effect is common  
Ghosting is very common in motion  


Motion in general is worse

_________

Other differences on FSR vs DLSS

DLSS handles Shimmering from TAA better removing some shimmering, however DLSS adds shimmering to some objects that don't normally shimmer. In any game that isn't TAA always on this is a downside to DLSS however in games with TAA as optional or not on this is a downside.


FSR looks kinda bad on the highest performance modes compared to DLSS highest performance modes. Ultra Quality on FSR looked better than Quality from DLSS imo though.

Game support is higher on DLSS right now however most games have pretty meh implementations. Also FSR is much easier to add to a game and its expected to have more game support eventually especially considering consoles will support it.

HOWEVER there has been a huge push in last 3 months from nvidia getting DLSS support in games so its not likely going to just die out too fast. If Nvidia continues their partnership to get RTX in more games it might take a while for FSR to take off so even though most people expect FSR to win overall in game support this could possibly take maybe even years before its actually the case so keep this in mind that buying gpu's for possible future support is always a gamble.

____


I am going to expand further on FSR that many people don't actually fully grasp supporting older hardware and explain something.

Certain DLSS titles like Rainboy 6 Siege and F1 added DLSS support but even the lowest end RTX card the 2060 can get over 100fps at 4k native in these titles. These 2 games its crazy that no RTX card would ever want to turn it on but maybe someone on a 1060 or something could benefit.

IMO you should never use DLSS in an FPS because the ghosting will ruin your aim however DLSS could be better for certain games  like a turn based strategy game where small tiny objects could preserve smaller details better and u don't have fast moving objects.

I personally cannot stand ghosting so I would never ever enable DLSS under any circumstances but this is my personal opinion some people don't mind ghosting for extra FPS.",prefix rundown fsr v dl differenceshere opinion difference fsr v dl pro dl v fsr handle taa shimmering better fsr standing still image often look bit better text billboard actually look fantastic con dl v fsr gpu support limited rtx card moire effect common ghosting common motion motion general worse difference fsr v dl dl handle shimmering taa better removing shimmering however dl add shimmering object normally shimmer game taa always downside dl however game taa optional downside fsr look kinda bad highest performance mode compared dl highest performance mode ultra quality fsr looked better quality dl imo though game support higher dl right however game pretty meh implementation also fsr much easier add game expected game support eventually especially considering console support however huge push last month nvidia getting dl support game likely going die fast nvidia continues partnership get rtx game might take fsr take even though people expect fsr win overall game support could possibly take maybe even year actually case keep mind buying gpu possible future support always gamble going expand fsr many people actually fully grasp supporting older hardware explain something certain dl title like rainboy siege f added dl support even lowest end rtx card get fps k native title game crazy rtx card ever want turn maybe someone something could benefit imo never use dl fps ghosting ruin aim however dl could better certain game like turn based strategy game small tiny object could preserve smaller detail better u fast moving object personally cannot stand ghosting never ever enable dl circumstance personal opinion people mind ghosting extra fps

In 2021, support for these APUs - if you run Windows - is now legacy and will not receive graphics driver feature/performance updates. Clearly, Polaris and Vega are on the chopping block next. Given how AMD previously moved GPUs to legacy in 2009, 2012, and 2015, a pessimistic estimate is that 3 years of life are left in the Cezanne Vega iGPU before it moves to legacy. Bristol Ridge had 4.7 years, and just under 4 if you count from DIY launch.

This has a bigger impact, many might not even think about!

If only there wasn't all these other things going around, Rona, Silicon shortage, crypto etc etc. And the fact that FidelityFX SR supports RX-500 and GTX 10-Series GPUs gives the people with these a little bit of extra juice before they too might be able to finally get one of the new cards for MSRP

At 1080p native with the lowest graphical settings the game runs (I just looked at the opening scene, didn't get into it) at about 11 FPS, with FSR Quality at around 15 FPS and FSR Performance at 17 FPS. Native 720p runs at 17 FPS. The 3D scene at 720p looks better than 1080p Performance, but the UI for FSR is at 1080p which is definitely noticeable. My choice of these would be FSR Quality, which is 720p upscaled and looks quite good, with 1080p UI.

I also ran at 720p with FSR Performance, and it looked like crap but ran at around 23 FPS. The game itself doesn't go much lower than 720p, so that kind of performance is only available with FSR. It might look like crap because it's rendering at 640x360, but it looks like crap with a 720p UI, so it should be at least somewhat playable.

Currently in running a 4790k with 16Gb 1333MHz ddr3 ram and really wanting to upgrade to the 5800x. As you can see I don't frequently my pc components as I don't see the point in upgrading with every generation to get minimal performance benefits, but if thats you then crack on.

My question is, should i hold out and wait until the AM5 cpus and boards and get the bigger performance benefits over ddr4/AM4 or should i just bite the bullet and upgrade now. 

As far as im aware, i believe that its due to realise within the next 12 months but im scared of price/reliability upon launch as well as having to replace the entire chipset should i want to upgrade sooner rather than later.

any comments are appriciated. Thanks!",wait ddr released upgradinghi poster occasional lurker currently running k gb mhz ddr ram really wanting upgrade x see frequently component see point upgrading every generation get minimal performance benefit thats crack question hold wait cpu board get bigger performance benefit ddr bite bullet upgrade far im aware believe due realise within next month im scared price reliability upon launch well replace entire chipset want upgrade sooner rather later comment appriciated thanks

Motherboard - MSI B450i Gaming Plus AC (latest beta bios, issue occur on both latest non-beta and beta bios. Contacting AMD they told me to update to beta...)  
Ram - Corsair 32GB 3200 C16 (CMK32GX4M2B3200C16)  
PSU - Corsair SF600 Platinum  
GFX - Gigabyte 1080 Turbo OC  
\*never OC'd, only XMP turned on

**Issue**

Started observing random BSOD and hard reboot (almost always overnight when I leave it on to do low load work such as download and/or automation task)  
I then turned off XMP, and observed same result  
I then did a clean Windows 10 Pro install and observed same result

**Diagnostic**

Memtest86 pass repeatedly (both XMP on and off)  
OCCT pass for free 1 hour test (both XMP on and off)  
Linpack Xtreme found no issue 1+ hour (XMP off, haven't tried XMP on)  
Prime95. This is where I can get a consistent failure.  
Ran PSU and GFX on another old Intel/DDR3 system on a Ubuntu USB boot, no issue with Prime95 over 8+hours on blend  
Ran on original system on same Ubuntu USB boot, same failure with Prime95 as observed in Windows

**Prime95 Failure**

Blend will always produce failure on Worker #3 or #4. Sometime after long enough, it will fail both and Ryzen Master will show Core 2 idle.  
Large FFT test also produces the same result consistently.  
Other FFT settings seems to be less consistent so far, sometime it'll be fine for a long time, sometimes not and always fail on the same Core.  
A strange thing is, I noticed sometime it'll fail Worker #3 immediately on stress start and almost always it'll fail consistently around 1hour 40min into the test when it's doing ""Self-test 896k""

**Fix Attempt**

Bump SoC voltage in 0.0125v increment offset. All same result. I stopped at 0.05v  
Bump VRAM voltage in 0.01v increment from 1.35v. All same result. I stopped at 1.38v

**Contact with AMD/Retailer**

I contacted AMD describing my issue. They told me to update BIOs to beta and give that a try, this resulted in same outcome. They then told me it'll be easier to contact retailer for warranty otherwise I have to pay shipping to Singapore... (I'm located in Australia)  
I contacted my retailer (Computer Alliance from QLD, Australia) and they told me to ship CPU/RAM/Mobo to them so they can test it out. They told me they couldn't reproduce the error and said it might be my PSU or GFX... (I'm a bit surprised they said it might be GFX when I described my consistent failure in Prime95... They used a generic 550w PSU and a GTX 1660), so they sent it back. I immediately was able to reproduce the issue again...

&amp;#x200B;

I've now purchased a new SF750 and will be trying that out when it arrives (although I'm skeptical since PSU and GFX is rock solid with an old Intel/DDR3).

Not sure what else I can try...

1,6,0,1,0,"CPPC tags.Do the CPPC tags for 1 chip relate to their performance against another chip?  I have had a 5600x a 5900x and now a 5950x.  With PBO boost turned on the 5900x has cppc tags from 181 to 164 on ccx1 and 160 to 139 on ccx2.  The 5600X has cppc tags in the same range as ccx2 on the 5900.  The 5950X has scores from 212 to 190 on ccx1 and 186 to 153 on ccx2.  I know that the 59xx chips always have a premium sample for ccx1 and I have been told both are premium on 5950x.  

Going off my experience with this one it's def a great sample, whereas my 5900x wasn't anything special but could hit the high benchmarks with the right amount of voltage.  So I am guessing that the higher cppc tag indicates the chip can hit its peak speeds at a lower voltage.  641 is the best single core cb20 score I can get so far with any ryzen 3.  With my new 5950x I only peaked at 1.43v to get that score and the avg v for the top 2 cores was much lower.  I think 641 is the best score I've had on all 3 chips so far but the voltage I needed was higher.

So does anyone want to share their cppc tags?  Anyone have a chip with unusually high or low ones?  I have noticed that the ranges are similar a lot of times in the diff chips.  I have also seen 5900x chips with cppc tags in the 200's.  So I want to see what people think of the scores and how they reflect the quality of the chip.",cppc tag cppc tag chip relate performance another chip x x x pbo boost turned x cppc tag ccx ccx x cppc tag range ccx x score ccx ccx know xx chip always premium sample ccx told premium x going experience one def great sample whereas x anything special could hit high benchmark right amount voltage guessing higher cppc tag indicates chip hit peak speed lower voltage best single core cb score get far ryzen x peaked v get score avg v top core much lower think best score chip far voltage needed higher anyone want share cppc tag anyone chip unusually high low one noticed range similar lot time diff chip also seen x chip cppc tag want see people think score reflect quality chip

1,2,0,1,0,"Upgrading the CPU for my Mini-ITX PC build.I made a secondary build with a Mini-ITX PC using some spare parts I had from my main PC build (like the R7 360 that I used as a place holder when I replaced the R9 390 with an RX 570).

Of course I cheaped out and got an AMD A4 5300B for $17 but that CPU is proven to be too slow for gaming in a lot of games and is a major bottleneck. So I wanted to upgrade this part to a faster CPU but I am stumped on what options are worth it.

The Ryzen APUs are a whole lot better (even the Ryzen-based Athlons trounces the A4 5300B) but it would cost far more for even the cheapest Ryzen APU since the cost of the motherboard and RAM would have to be considered. So this leaves me capped with the APUs supported on my current motherboard for budget reasons at the moment. Which CPU/APU would be a better fit, the AMD A10 7860K, A10 7700K or A8 7600? The A8 7600 is generally found cheap but I am not sure what the performance difference is between an A10 7860K, 7700K and 7600 on the CPU side of things, seems like most of the difference is in the integrated GPU size.",upgrading cpu mini itx build made secondary build mini itx using spare part main build like r used place holder replaced r rx course cheaped got amd b cpu proven slow gaming lot game major bottleneck wanted upgrade part faster cpu stumped option worth ryzen apus whole lot better even ryzen based athlons trounces b cost far even cheapest ryzen apu since cost motherboard ram considered leaf capped apus supported current motherboard budget reason moment cpu apu better fit amd k k generally found cheap sure performance difference k k cpu side thing seems like difference integrated gpu size

So I get in the ring and the new system build fight starts: 

first blow is landed on myself, after a day of installation nothing happens when I turn on the system, it takes me a while to figure out that some moron decided all the mobo cables couldnt be put in one cable and there are two more connections on the mobo ""for the CPU"". 

Anyway, next blow is landed by Microsoft -- Windows 7 ""no can do"" AMD 5950x, so now I have to install Windows 10, I am a bit stunned, but... okay, I can handle that.

Now AMD lands the knockout punch -- no video card driver -- AMD recommended, latest driver, an old version 18.2.1, not even the version installed by Windows during OS installation (the OS somehow realizes it and uninstalls that driver itself) is compatible with my system none of these drivers either installs correctly or allows my computer to run more than a few seconds before crashing. 

So I am stuck on ""Microsoft Basic Display Adapter"" and the system runs solid. I sure hope new GPU prices start coming down soon. But with the big computer companies seemingly intentionally creating drivers and systems that are incompatible with older hardware, I don't see new hardware prices coming down anytime soon.

1,43,0,1,0,"Swapping from i7-8700k to R9 5900X in 3-4 months, need advice on new platform componentsHi there dear AMD community!

Having been an Intel user for over 20 years, I've finally decided to give AMD a try because so far I'm incredibly impressed by their performance with the 5XXX series. It shits on Intel pretty much everywhere as far as 1440p gaming and productivity goes.

I'm currently rocking an i7-8700k with 1080 Ti in my system and would like to switch to a 5900X this year with a 3080 somewhere near year when/if the price pathology ends. 

Since I'm clueless as far as AMD goes, I would like to ask you friends for some advice - I'm going to have to switch my entire platform, therefore I'd really appreciate it if you guys could hook me up with some components.

I plan to go with the R9 5900x - I'm mostly doing gaming at 1440p144hz, but I also do some intermediate video editing in Sony Vegas and After Effects therefore the 4 extra cores and higher cache of the 5900X are a nice bonus compared to the 5800X, so please don't try to persuade me to go 5800X.

Since I've used only Intel up to this point, I also need a decent mobo, I plan to overclock the CPU, but nothing extraordinairy, not pushing any limits. From what I've heard 4.5 - 4.6 GHz should be easily achievable, therefore I would love to have you guys suggest me a good mobo for it, some criteria below:

- I'm a sucker for looks, so some lighting would be nice. 
- Needs some decent VRM so I could go for a 4.5 - 4.6 GHz overclock on all cores, or something along these lines. 
- I only have a single NVMe M.2 SSD, and one SATA SSD.

From what I've heard RAM plays a very important role in overclocking the Ryzen CPUs. My RAM at the moment is what I would define as subpar: GoodRam IRDM X, DDR4, 2x8 GB, 3000MHz, CL16 overclocked to 3666 MHz at about CL18-19.

To top if off I'd also need to get to get a better AIO to cool that beast. I currently have Coolermaster MasterLiquid 240mm AIO, but I'm not sure it'll be compatible with the AM4/5900X. I've never used AMD before so I am totally out of the loop on that format.

From what I've heard and seen on benchmarks the Arctic Liquid Freezer II 240, being relatively new, seems to be somewhat of a beast in terms of cooling. It's cheap, not really flashy, but it doesn't need to have any fancy screens on the pump or RGB, I can ""flash it out"" myself by just replacing the fans for some Corsair LL ones if need be. 

My PUS is EVGA SuperNOVA G+ 750W 80+ Gold. I'm thinking it'll be enough. I'm currently using it to power i7-8700k oc'd to 5.1 ghz with 1080 Ti running at max 120% powerdraw. 

So what I need:

- new Mobo: will want to overclock all cores to 4.5/4.6 ghz, RGB appreciated but not needed
- new RAM, at least 16 GB dual channel upgraded to 32 gb quad channel in the future (RGB goodness appreciated, should be capable of running the 5900X overclocked to 4.5/4.6 all cores)
- new AIO (possibly Arctic Liquid Freezer II 240)

I really appreciate your help and hope you guys have a great day.",swapping k r x month need advice platform componentshi dear amd community intel user year finally decided give amd try far incredibly impressed performance xxx series shit intel pretty much everywhere far p gaming productivity go currently rocking k ti system like switch x year somewhere near year price pathology end since clueless far amd go like ask friend advice going switch entire platform therefore really appreciate guy could hook component plan go r x mostly gaming p hz also intermediate video editing sony vega effect therefore extra core higher cache x nice bonus compared x please try persuade go x since used intel point also need decent mobo plan overclock cpu nothing extraordinairy pushing limit heard ghz easily achievable therefore love guy suggest good mobo criterion sucker look lighting nice need decent vrm could go ghz overclock core something along line single nvme ssd one sata ssd heard ram play important role overclocking ryzen cpu ram moment define subpar goodram irdm x ddr x gb mhz cl overclocked mhz cl top also need get get better aio cool beast currently coolermaster masterliquid mm aio sure compatible x never used amd totally loop format heard seen benchmark arctic liquid freezer ii relatively seems somewhat beast term cooling cheap really flashy need fancy screen pump rgb flash replacing fan corsair one need pu evga supernova g w gold thinking enough currently using power k oc ghz ti running max powerdraw need mobo want overclock core ghz rgb appreciated needed ram least gb dual channel upgraded gb quad channel future rgb goodness appreciated capable running x overclocked core aio possibly arctic liquid freezer ii sorry wall text hopefully much bother really appreciate help hope guy great day

**New UEFI BIOS updates For ASUS AMD  motherboards – W24**

\*Please do not ask about motherboards not listed. Please review the FAQ below for details.  
   
 

**AMD – X570**

These releases are a continuation of the recent post-announcement communicating 400/500 series boards will be receiving this [1.2.0.3]( Patch A release as we move into Q3. All boards are expected to be updated by end of July possibly early August.  
   
 

**UEFI BIOS update list noted below – A total of 6 boards with a UEFI BIOS update.**

**W24 is in relation to the workweek, these updates were released between the June 11th-16th**

***Why is my motherboard not listed?***

It may have been recently updated. Check  to see if it has been. I post updates on a weekly basis. UEFI’s are released in waves, because of this it can take an entire series weeks or months to see the “same” update if it includes items like CPU firmware. Furthermore, keep in mind that not all updates are applicable to all models. Due to inherent design differences as well as specification and feature variation an update may only be applicable to a specific model.

***How can I be notified about UEFI updates when they are released?***

If you want to be kept in the loop, you can also follow me for notifications when updates are released/posted. I am also the admin for our PCDIY Facebook Group where I post updates and other ASUS centric product news [ 

***How long after a board is produced will UEFI updates be released?***

Keep in mind that generally after a year a motherboard reaches a certain maturity level and as such will see fewer updates. If you feel you have an issue that is dependent on a UEFI release, please submit a support ticket. In some cases, some boards can see updates for more than 24 months+

***I want to update but am not sure how to update the UEFI ""BIOS""?***

If you want guidance on how to flash/update your UEFI BIOS please watch the video linked below.

[ 

***Should I update the UEFI if my system is stable and running without issue?***

If your system is running without issue, especially if overclocked in any way ( including DRAM ) it is advised you stay on the build/release you are on. Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can change the OC experience and require you to retune a previously stable OC value. This does not mean the UEFI is not a functioning release but that changes in the underlying code base need to be accounted for when tuning a system. As many of these values are in low level or specific operating parameters it is best to retune from full UEFI defaults after you have re-run stability test at UEFI defaults.

***What if the UEFI BIOS listed is a BETA? Should I update?***

BETA UEFI releases are for enthusiasts who want access to the latest features, functions, and microcode enhancements, and overall UEFI improvements. As they are not officially supported, they are not recommended for day-to-day / long-term use. Users who plan to use their system in this capacity and want to ensure the best interoperability/compatibility and stability, as well as performance, should wait for a formal release.  
 

***How long does it take for a formal release to be issued (between BETA and formal)?***  
 

The time span between a BETA and formal release can vary depending on multiple factors including new internal code being provided, validation and qualification as well as other important aspects of UEFI development and validation. Generally, you will see a formal release within 1 to 3 months. In some cases, BETAs are singular releases and will not see a formal release.

***Will a UEFI ""BIOS"" update improve the performance of my system?***

A UEFI update can include CPU microcode as well as other performance tuning enhancements that can influence/increase performance. With this noted it is generally minimal. As always performance analysis/comparisons should be done at stock-to-stock values. This means loading F5 on both releases and comparing your application/benchmark scores. OC-related comparisons may require retuning prior to testing as changes to underlying auto rules can invalidate prior scores even if with similar settings.

***Not every user should update/flash their UEFI BIOS. I stress this again, if you are running without issue(s) you are advised to stay on the release you are running.*** 

***Notes to consider -***

***\* When flashing please perform the update process at full UEFI defaults. Do NOT flash with an overclocked system/profile.***

1.I recommend updating the UEFI BIOS on your motherboard for new PC builds. This helps to ensure the best interoperability, compatibility, and performance. If you are building a PC and have not yet installed the OS, I would recommend you update the UEFI.

2.Keep in mind flashing/updating the UEFI will reset all defined parameters/settings and operating profiles. You will not be able to restore defined values by using a UEFI Profile as profiles are not interoperable between builds. It is advised you note or screenshot (F12) your values prior to flashing if they are complex. Upon completing a flash, I would recommend you load UEFI defaults after the fact and complete a full reboot and shutdown prior to re-entering your prior values. Keep in mind you may need to retune these values under a new UEFI.

3.When you update the UEFI and re-load UEFI defaults depending on your originally defined CSM/UEFI device parameters you may experience BOOT issues. Depending on prior settings you may need to enable or disable CSM to restore BOOT functionality.

4.Be advised that in some cases a rollback to a prior UEFI is not possible. This generally is the case when there is an update that includes CPU microcode (such as an AMD AEGSA or Intel ME). This means you may not be able to “flashback” to a prior release.

5.While not always necessary some UEFI updates may require a clearing of the CMOS. You can either clear the CMOS via the CLR CMOS button if your motherboard has this feature/function or you can also CLR CMOS by removing the onboard CMOS battery for at least a few minutes. You can also attempt to locate the CLR CMOS jumper on the motherboard and short the pins.

6.In some cases, you may not be able to jump from an older UEFI release to a much newer release. You may need to ""step"" update, this will mean upgrading incrementally to a slightly newer build first prior to going to the most recent build/release. In most situations this not required.

I also recommend you backup your system prior to any flash/update and always advise flash/update become executed from a fresh loading (F5) of UEFI defaults.

The board model/name is on the right-hand side and the version number is on the left-hand side. To download the UEFI BIOS please go to

1,218,0,132,0,"AMD: Radeon Image Sharpening (RIS) has been a big hit, and I think I speak for many gamers when I say we'd like to see more features like RIS in the future!I have the privilege of being an old gamer, and I say privilege because I've been lucky enough to see a lot of technological advancements that others were just born into.  Over the years that I've been using AMD a lot of features have been added to our cards.  

Some features have been extremely convenient, like Chill and Frame Rate Target Control (FRTC), both of which were small, but *important,* problem solvers.  

Some features I just have to take your word for it that they're working, I can't *see* Anti-Lag or Enhanced Sync working, they're practically under the hood from my perspective, but I enable them because why not?  
  
And some features I simply can't live without today, features like FreeSync Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) and Radeon Image Sharpening (RIS) are now a foregone requirement for any monitor or GPU purchase I make.  The improvement to image quality is dramatic, I can't go back.  
  
Radeon Image Sharpening is, I believe, a post-processing filter, it's a layer added on top of a fully rendered frame.  Post-processing effects are nothing new, gamers have been using SweetFx and ReShade for more than a decade now, even AMD touched its toe into the water some time ago when they released their Morphological Anti-Aliasing (MLAA) filter.  What I'm getting at is that this is known and familiar technology, devs know how it works, hell, *you guys* know how it works because *you guys* added RIS and MLAA to your drivers!  
  
With that in mind, there are a *ton* of post-processing filters that I think would be useful on your cards.  These are off the top of my head, and more informed users can provide a better list, this should just be considered a starting point.  (In no particular order.)  
  
Semi-objective image quality improvements:  
  
 * Anti-aliasing: (SMAA, TAA, FXAA, MLAA, NFAA, etc) can be used by just about anybody playing a game with sub-par built in AA, and there are a lot of them.    
 * Film grain: Film grain can help address color banding and hide graphical imperfections.  
 * Ambient occlusion: (MXAO) can be used to inject very, very *rough* ambient occlusion into a game that may not have it.  
 * Fake HDR: Deepen the black levels in a game to give it an ""HDR-look"" without having to have an HDR monitor.  
 * Color adjustments: Vibrancy, brightness, contrast, hue, color balance, saturation, and anything else you can think of to let a player dial in their perfect picture.  
 * Color adjustments 2: Could you guys do a driver level color-blind filter?  Because holy hell could a lot of people benefit from that!  
 * ~~Image Sharpening: You already did this one, and I love it!~~  
  
Subjective image quality improvements:  
  
 * Vignette filters: Darken the corners of the screen to bring the player deeper into the center of the picture.  
 * Chromatic aberration: A prismatic lens flare effect, can add a lot of atmosphere to a picture.    
 * Motion blur: Okay, so, 99.9% of us turn off motion blur just by default, but it could still be a potentially useful filter to have on hand for LFR gamers.  (NiOH 1 had a *very subtle* motion blur filter, maybe you could use that?)  
  
Screenshot filters:  
  
 * Bloom: Can give light sources the illusion of casting actual light.    
 * Lens Flare: Don't look at the sun!    
 * Depth of Field: Set the focal distance of the camera/image to better draw a viewer's attention.  
 * (As a side note, there are many fully *playable* bloom, flare, and DoF filters available, I usually leave bloom enabled when I'm gaming, but by and large these are novelty filters.)  
  
Utility filters:  
  
 * Distortion Correction and Perfect Perspective: Useful for people with curved monitors to get a closer to natural image.  (I think.  I don't have a curved monitor.)  
  
Look, I'm just telling you stuff you already know.  There are dozens of unique post-processing filters available today, many of them can provide fairly *objective* image improvements, like Sharpening and Anti-aliasing; many provide subjective improvements, like Chromatic Aberration and Vignette; many provide useful tools for screenshot artists, like DoF and Bloom; and some of them correct problems, like skewed perspectives.  There's a little bit of something for everyone in the filter bucket, I imagine that even hardcore gamers could benefit from having an additional way to limit their frame rate (Yet another filter in ReShade), and casual gamers like myself would probably love to smooth out our graphics with a touch of film grain, everyone gets *something.*  
  
Radeon Image Sharpening is a *default on* feature for me, I don't turn it off anymore, I don't use sharpening filters in ReShade anymore either, and I know I'm not alone in this.  Customers from all across your product line benefitted when you released RIS, many of us can't do without it anymore, and I think adding more filters similar to RIS would be a (comparatively) easy win, one that the vast majority of us would use.  
  
I'm not calling for full scale integration and implementation of SweetFx/ReShade (Though that would be cool!), if AMD wanted to you could just pick a handful of existing filters and stability test the hell out of them, or make your own proprietary filters specifically designed for your cards and drivers, it's not the under the hood stuff that I'm worried about, it's what's on the screen.  
  
With the above in mind, I'd like to add on one more, supplemental, request: Modernize Adrenaline's legacy filter effects, you know the ones: AA Use/Enhance/Override, AA Method MSAA/AMSAA/SSAA, MLAA Enable/Disable, AF Disabled/Enabled, etc.  Pretty much the whole bottom two thirds of the graphics options menu.  (There are a lot more features I'd like to see added to Adrenaline, too, double V-Sync, LOD adjustments, set flip queue size, stuff like that, but that's a whole other post.)  
  
Most of us use RIS every time we game, there's an opportunity there, an opportunity that I hope you'll take.",amd radeon image sharpening ri big hit think speak many gamers say like see feature like ri future privilege old gamer say privilege lucky enough see lot technological advancement others born year using amd lot feature added card feature extremely convenient like chill frame rate target control frtc small important problem solver feature take word working see anti lag enhanced sync working practically hood perspective enable feature simply live without today feature like freesync variable refresh rate vrr radeon image sharpening ri foregone requirement monitor gpu purchase make improvement image quality dramatic go back radeon image sharpening believe post processing filter layer added top fully rendered frame post processing effect nothing gamers using sweetfx reshade decade even amd touched toe water time ago released morphological anti aliasing mlaa filter getting known familiar technology devs know work hell guy know work guy added ri mlaa driver mind ton post processing filter think useful card top head informed user provide better list considered starting point particular order semi objective image quality improvement anti aliasing smaa taa fxaa mlaa nfaa etc used anybody playing game sub par built aa lot film grain film grain help address color banding hide graphical imperfection ambient occlusion mxao used inject rough ambient occlusion game may fake hdr deepen black level game give hdr look without hdr monitor color adjustment vibrancy brightness contrast hue color balance saturation anything else think let player dial perfect picture color adjustment could guy driver level color blind filter holy hell could lot people benefit image sharpening already one love subjective image quality improvement vignette filter darken corner screen bring player deeper center picture chromatic aberration prismatic lens flare effect add lot atmosphere picture motion blur okay u turn motion blur default could still potentially useful filter hand lfr gamers nioh subtle motion blur filter maybe could use screenshot filter bloom give light source illusion casting actual light lens flare look sun depth field set focal distance camera image better draw viewer attention side note many fully playable bloom flare dof filter available usually leave bloom enabled gaming large novelty filter utility filter distortion correction perfect perspective useful people curved monitor get closer natural image think curved monitor look telling stuff already know dozen unique post processing filter available today many provide fairly objective image improvement like sharpening anti aliasing many provide subjective improvement like chromatic aberration vignette many provide useful tool screenshot artist like dof bloom correct problem like skewed perspective little bit something everyone filter bucket imagine even hardcore gamers could benefit additional way limit frame rate yet another filter reshade casual gamers like probably love smooth graphic touch film grain everyone get something radeon image sharpening default feature turn anymore use sharpening filter reshade anymore either know alone customer across product line benefitted released ri many u without anymore think adding filter similar ri comparatively easy win one vast majority u use calling full scale integration implementation sweetfx reshade though cool amd wanted could pick handful existing filter stability test hell make proprietary filter specifically designed card driver hood stuff worried screen mind like add one supplemental request modernize adrenaline legacy filter effect know one aa use enhance override aa method msaa amsaa ssaa mlaa enable disable af disabled enabled etc pretty much whole bottom two third graphic option menu lot feature like see added adrenaline double v sync lod adjustment set flip queue size stuff like whole post u use ri every time game opportunity opportunity hope take

1,18,0,1,0,"FSR and VSR tag team..?This may in fact be a stupid question, but here goes...

I suspect FSR will truly only look its best and be effective at 4k. I personally game at 1440p for two reasons...

1) my TV can only go to 60hz at 4k, and my freesync range is  a paltry 48-60hz at 4k

2) I set my desktop to 1440p because I get 120hz, and the full freesync gamut of 40-120hz on my TV at that resolution. It's just a better experience.


I think the loss in fidelity will be much more noticeable when applying FSR to visuals rendered natively at 1440p.

So a light bulb went off in my head, and my question is this... would it be possible to use VSR in conjunction with FSR? I would set my VSR at 4k 120hz while also applying FSR to the rendering on virtual display.

The idea is that I get the benefit of FSR performance uplift without as much loss in visual fidelity. In my brain it feels like this would give me a baked in AA solution, and my 6800 should still be able to provide high stable fps thanks to the bump provided by FSR on VSR.",fsr vsr tag team may fact stupid question go suspect fsr truly look best effective k personally game p two reason tv go hz k freesync range paltry hz k set desktop p get hz full freesync gamut hz tv resolution better experience think loss fidelity much noticeable applying fsr visuals rendered natively p light bulb went head question possible use vsr conjunction fsr set vsr k hz also applying fsr rendering virtual display idea get benefit fsr performance uplift without much loss visual fidelity brain feel like give baked aa solution still able provide high stable fps thanks bump provided fsr vsr

I  purchased a 6800XT Midnight Black and have been having constant crashes.  I've reinstalled my OS, reverted drivers, updated my BIOS, done  everything I can think of from a software standpoint to get it to work.  Every time I get an error report when a game crashes, it is always  something to do with graphics issues (DirectX errors, PhysX errors,  shader errors, etc). The only new part in my system is the GPU. And,  yes, I am using two separate PCIe cables for my card.

So,  I put in a warranty request to RMA my card. The kicker? My PSU is a  650W. So, the person dealing with my request asked me to go purchase a  brand new 750W power supply, even though I have experienced zero system  restarts or BSOD screens. I have also had no events in the event viewer  signifying a power issue.

I bought the PSU. It didn't fix the issue. So now not only do I have a computer that doesn't work, I am also down $120.

1,198,0,81,2,"AMD Direct Buying Guide: How to actually get a GPU or CPU**Introduction**

This will be a guide on how you can actually buy a card or CPU from AMD Direct. Note, this guide is for NA. For context, I have been able to get four things from AMD Direct. 1) 6800 that I bought back in Feb. 2) Ryzen 9 5900X that I bought for a friend last month. 3) 6800 XT Midnight Black last week. 4) 6700 XT that I also bought for a friend just today.

It is suprisingly not that difficult to get a card from AMD Direct once you learn these steps, and while having some patience.

**Choosing a card/CPU**

It feels lke I'm writing a guide for a game, but some cards are rarer than others. In order from least to most rare:

GPUs:

    6700 XT -&gt; 6800 -&gt; 6900 XT -&gt; 6800 XT -&gt; 6800 XT Midnight

For CPU's, the 5900X seems to be easier to get than the 5950X. The 5600X and 5800X CPU's are readily available now.

Keep this in mind for when you decide what card/CPU you want to get. *If I personally didn't have a card, I'd try to go for the 6800 Non-XT or 6700 XT.*

**Step 1: Getting ready**

There are really four main things you need to have/know before you buy something:

* What time/day AMD drops
* The ""Add To Cart"" script
* The StockDrops Discord server (optional?)
* Refresh Bans

AMD usually drops on Thursdays at 11:30 AM EST or 8:30 AM PST. So, you're going to want to get on a little before those times.

The Add To Cart (ATC) button appears differently by region, but thankfully, there is a script that makes it appear regardless of your region.

The script is incredibly simple, no need to install any programs. To use it, you simply create a bookmark of your choice, and for the URL, you want to copy and paste this:

    javascript:(async () =&gt; { s=document.createElement('script'); s.innerHTML=(await (await fetch(` Date().getTime()}`)).text()); document.body.appendChild(s); })()

You're going to want to keep this bookmark in your bookmarks bar, [as so]( You can actually test the script right now without there being a drop, simply go to any product page on AMD Direct, and when you're on the page hit the bookmark on your bookmarks bar. You'll see the button change from OOS to ATC and it'll attempt to add to cart.

Another thing to know about is about Refresh Bans. Basically, if you refresh the AMD Direct pages too many times, you will get banned from buying anything for 24 hours. There will be cases (in later steps) where you *will* have to refresh, and so you want to keep your refreshes minimal. More on this later. If you get banned however, you can clear your browser's cookies and you should be unbanned, but this means you have to restart if you have something in your cart (this will make more sense later).

Once you have the script and know the other info, you're pretty much good to go. But I have to give a shout out to the StockDrops discord server for being the only reason I know of any of this. I recommend you join the server, and near the time there is a drop, in the #general-na channel, others will also be there trying to get a card. It's useful as some people can provide info during the drop, like if a drop is still happening or if Captchas are starting to appear (more on Captchas later). The link if you join is discord.gg/stockdrops

**Step 2: The drop happens**

Pretend now that it's Thursday at 11:30 AM EST. It's time to get a card. See if others in the StockDrops Discord server have seen cards/CPUs being dropped. In order to see if they're actually dropping on your own, or if others on the Discord are indicating that a drop is happening, you're going to want to hit the ATC Script from earlier on the page of the card/CPU you want, and you'll see it try to add the card/CPU for you. If you see a Captcha pop up, there is 100% a drop occuring. If not, then you just need to keep trying. Sometimes the Captcha doesn't pop up right away.

Once the Captcha does appear, most of the time, the Captcha will just time out. You're going to want to keep trying the Captcha and the second ATC button (you will see a second ATC button appear once you completed the Captcha).

Be patient. The card/CPU will more than likely not appear in your cart at first. You're gonna want to keep trying.

If the Captcha page dissapears **and** you notice that the first Add to Cart button no longer works (sometimes the Captcha dissapears but the first ATC button still works, in that case just hit the button again), you're going to want to hit the refresh button. The script will start working again.

Eventually, you will see [this page]( pop up, this means its in your cart. Now, it's time to checkout.

**Step 3: Checking out**

*I just got a 503 error!*

You will, 100%, get a 503 error. Do not worry, this doesn't mean the card/CPU is gone. You're simply going to hit refresh if you get a 503. Don't spam it, you're gonna see the loading icon spin in the top on your tab. If you refresh and see the icon is not spinning anymore, hit refresh again. If you see the icon spinning for a very long time, you will probably get to the payment info screen.

Just know that any time you get a 503, regardless of what page you're on, just refresh. Don't spam it, only hit refresh again if you see the loading icon isn't spinning anymore.

Once you get to the Payment Info screen, I recommend you *don't* use PayPal. That itself can freeze, so I recommend you just plug in your payment details manually. I recommend setting up Chrome's auto credit card feature for this. It'll be the fastest way to input your info.

Once you're done with that, you're gonna want to go to the Shipping Page by hitting the Next button at the bottom. This itself may not load right away (you'll see a spinning circle). If you see the circle dissapear and it hasn't loaded, just hit the Next button again.

Once you're on the Shipping Info page, by default, the page will ship to your payment info's address, and will ship with 5-7 Days shipping with Fedex. If this is fine for you, you don't have to do anything on this page, and so as soon as you get the Shipping Page, just hit next to go to the Complete Order page. Like before, the circle may dissapear when you hit Next. Just keep trying slowly.

Throughout all this, you will probably get more 503's. Just remember what I said before.

You will then get to the Complete Order page. Once here, you want to accept the Terms and Conditions check box and hit Place Order. This, once again, may not work right away. You may get a 503, or the button will just not work. Don't spam the Place Order button, but do click it in small intervals.

If you've made it past this point, and the Place Order button works, you will be redirected to a Order Confirmation screen. This means you probably got a card/CPU. There are cases though, which the order can get cancelled, and that's really not something you can control unfortunately. So as long as you got to this page, you're mostly good to go, and secured a card/CPU.

**Closing**

That's basically how you get a card. It just requires a little patience and following the steps religiously to get a card. If anyone is confused by anything I've said or needs some sort of visual examples, I'm 100% willing to provide those.

Otherwise, I hope this guide leads to at least one actual gamer getting a card.

I don't have any information and I couldn't find any benchmark. I read before that this cpu with its Apu can handle light video editing but I'm kina confused. So my question is can Ryzen 4650g handle this? will it work properly? or I shouldn't buy it.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to pair my cpu with 2 × 8gig of DDR4 3200mhz  memory running in dual channel mode and Asus prime A520m-A motherboard. I know it may not be a good combination but I'm on a tight budget. 

Any Help would be appreciated.",ryzen g good video editing hi guy want build recording gameplay somehow creating funny moment video purpose looked benchmark found ryzen g planning buy ryzen g know whether cpu apu meet need mean recording gameplay editing using adobe premiere pro information find benchmark read cpu apu handle light video editing kina confused question ryzen g handle work properly buy x b want pair cpu gig ddr mhz memory running dual channel mode asus prime motherboard know may good combination tight budget help appreciated

3070

Idle temps - 42c
Ambient temps - 22c

Everytime the PC is booted it reaches 90c. During a game, the same story, which I've kind of dealt with, but due to it getting into summer, and using the PC for work, my room is becoming more and more unbearable.

Went out and purchased an Arctic Liquid Freezer 2, thinking this was my issue, as I previously had a Dark Rock Pro 4. Nope, still hitting 90 out of the gate. Yes, I've remounted, and checked my thermal paste spread, so much so I've gone through a whole tube of MX4.

Stock, it is getting around 5600 within R20, as it hits 90c straight away at 100% load.

This last week since receiving the new cooler, I've tried changing some settings within Ryzen Master, and within the BIOS (not exclusively mutual). Changing PPT/TDC/EDC values, which does bring my temps down to 85ish, but still it's a little unbearable. Changing the values, does also result in a better R20 score, as I actually reached 5900 following this [thread]( but it's not hugely stable. Also attempted to offset voltage up to -.1 (increasing with testing) which has resulted in a max boost clock of 3999, but still reaching 83c

I know I'm going to get comments like ""It's a hot chip, AMD say it's meant to run at 90"". But at the moment, I'm only asking for assistance and advice from the community to see if anyone else has tried something that has seen results, that's possibly in the same boat as I.

I'm not a total noob at computers, but I am when it comes to overclocking/underclocking, that's fairly new to me.

1,28,0,0,1,"Reduce your Ryzen 3000, Ryzen 5000 CPU temps by -20°C with this 1 trick.Are you a Zen 2 or Zen 3 CPU user worried about your CPU temps spike? Do you see your CPU temps spiking to 60 °C or maybe 70 °C when just opening a folder?

Then this trick will help with that. *But caution, this isn't for everyone and you may prefer to not make the changes should you desire. AMD's default recommendations are perfectly fine.*

If you're using a Ryzen 3000 Series or a Ryzen 5000 Series CPU and want to reduce your idle temps spiking up like crazy, all you need to do to stop this is to head to the below address in your computer to make the changes.

**Address:** Control Panel\\All Control Panel Items\\Power Options\\Edit Plan Settings

Basically, head to the control panel power option and edit the power settings. Preferably the Ryzen power plans. Be it Ryzen Balanced or Ryzen High Performance. Which ever you choose to select, head inside and edit the settings. The Sleep / Hibernate / USB suspending options aside, look at the image below.

Preferably, keep the minimum processor state at 99% AND ALSO the 'Maximum Processor State' at 99%. Then click Apply. Then if you check in hwinfo64 or hardware monitor or AMD Ryzen Master (whichever you choose to use everyday), you will notice that the temp spikes are gone.

**What this will do** is stop your CPU from clocking above the base clock in order to stop the temp spike by drawing in very high idle voltages. 

Now, is this same as underclocking? Not really. It's just a simple 1 trick method to not allow your CPU to boost above base. And apparently, boosting above base in those millisecond intervals spike the temps a lot. That's what is prevented here.

A few things to advise however. Even though your daily desktop workloads such as media and browsing will be unaffected, in your games you will see a drop in performance depending upon the speed of your graphics card. This is because your CPU will be hard limited to Base Clocks. In my case, the R7 3700x will be limited till 3600 Mhz or 3.6 Ghz. Even though gaming experience will still be fluid for those locked frame rate users, you won't get the maximum out of the CPU.

If that is fine with you, then this trick should help. I reckon it's going to be a very helpful trick for the stock cooler gang! GG! GL! Peace!

Hi guys,

Our team is currently procuring a new numerical modelling PC to replace our old one. We have budget for an sTRX4 3990X (very excite) which will be a game changer coming from our six-year old Haswell machine.

However, I’m having trouble finding some information that might present a fatal flaw to the build. I can’t find any information on whether we can use an Intel-based system to Remote Desktop to this new AMD-based system. Right now we use an Intel-based laptop to connect to the existing Intel-based modelling PC; does anyone know if there will be any issues remoting from an Intel laptop to an AMD PC via Remote Desktop? I’ve seen sources claiming this won’t work but they might have just been referring to VM migration rather than VM operation. Any advice here would be appreciated.

We’re also unsure what the best host is. VMware appears popular but looks to be a paid product. Are good free options available or is VMware worth the cash?

Finally, from what I've read it appears a discrete GPU per VM provides the best performance outside of the high-end stuff like NVIDIA Quadro 6000 or higher (sadly our modelling software is only NVIDIA compatible...). Is a discrete GPU per VM the best method from your experience?

Any other general tips or tricks would be super helpful :) Thanks!",discussion using threadripper hosting two vms hi guy team currently procuring numerical modelling replace old one budget strx x excite game changer coming six year old haswell machine however trouble finding information might present fatal flaw build find information whether use intel based system remote desktop amd based system right use intel based laptop connect existing intel based modelling anyone know issue remoting intel laptop amd via remote desktop seen source claiming work might referring vm migration rather vm operation advice appreciated also unsure best host vmware appears popular look paid product good free option available vmware worth cash finally read appears discrete gpu per vm provides best performance outside high end stuff like nvidia quadro higher sadly modelling software nvidia compatible discrete gpu per vm best method experience general tip trick super helpful thanks

1,52,0,0,0,"Ryzen appears to benefit from less input lag the lower the memory speed (1:1:1 already)This is the ultimate redpill, but I have strong reason to believe that latency of the mouse increases as we upclock the memclock and fabric at 1:1 ratio. It's strange, but at least on an asus or asrock motherboard, setting the lowest possible cas latency and primary timing set, then running the ram at the lowest possible frequency, seems to consistently produce the lowest input lag compared to high frequencies and even XMP. Even though FPS goes down and the benchmarks go down too. 

This is completely despite XMP, and even when XMP is on, the feel of the mouse cannot match. I've tested mostly with single and dual channel, but I will confirm at a later date if dual channel causes more input lag also. 

Before you throw me under the bin, I don't have equipment to test, just 10 years of shooters and 7 years of csgo. I've got a decent memory and a good feel of the mouse, and hit DMG back when things were rosy and crisp and snappy; when I used a gtx 660ti, a intel 3570k, on a z77x-ud5h and 16gb of single channel ram (because my CPU pin contact was a bit crap, so it always bsodded when I ran dual lol).

Previous setup and current setup are as follows: AB350 Pro 4, then into the B550-A from Asus. I suspected that ASROCK had some hot trash memory auto timings, but that seems to not be the case if you manually set the primary timings. R9 280x, 5600x, 2x8=16gb Patriot 4400mhz clocked at 10-10-10-10-20 primaries, 1t, power and gear down disable, and in single channel. Secondaries are all left on auto. 

If someone can confirm my findings, this would make my day, because playing any first person shooter feels like an absolute chore, and as if there was a layer of soap between my G502 and the 170hz CRT running off an onboard dac. Maybe there is some credence to the accusation of higher input lag on ryzen? I've been using it for the last 4 years, and since the start it just felt... off.

I recently bought this PC from BestBuy: [

My Motherboard is MSI B450M/ac R2.0. It currently has Crucial Ballistix DDR4-3000 MHz RAM installed. I have recently read that Ryzen 3000 series benefit from higher RAM speeds, and am considering purchasing Crucial Ballistix DDR4-3600. Moreover, in reviewing my userbenchmark results, my RAM is always the lowest performing component. I am uncertain if that is limiting my overall performance.

I am currently playing Hell Let Loose (which is a poorly optimized game) and will be looking to play BF6 when it comes out. As such, is upgrading to 3600 MHz worth it? Should I purchase the Crucial Ballistix, or is there a better RAM to go with?

Lastly, I play at 1440p. Not sure if that is relevant.

I've  been able to get it semi-stable at the listed DOCP setting  (3600/16-16-16-36), but occasionally the comp will fail on restart, and  I'll have to mess with ram voltage to get up and  running. Right now I'm  pushing it at 1.47v.

1,130,0,159,1,"PSA: If you are using a 300-series AM4 motherboard with an old BIOS you may need to update the BIOS in order to install/update to Windows 10 2004/20H2/21H2.I don't know if there has been a post about this on the subreddit before however now that support for version 1909 has ended I feel it's important to bring this information to the attention of anyone using a 300-series AM4 motherboard as they might not have noticed that their Windows 10 installation has failed to update to one of the later major versions and is therefore no longer receiving updates at all including security updates.

I've first learned of this issue a month ago when I was asked to help with a PC with a 300-series AM4 motherboard that refused to update.

#Symptoms:

Attempting to upgrade to version 2004 or later from Windows 10 1909 or earlier results in error 0xC1900101 (though I've also seen other errors in the update history). You also won't be able to install Windows 10 2004/20H2/21H1 as booting using the installation media will freeze at the Windows logo and the PC will restart.

#Affected hardware:

Looking at posts about this issue it seems that all affected machines have one thing in common: AM4 300-series motherboards with an old BIOS. It's impossible to say if this affects all 300-series AM4 motherboards but it doesn't seem to be limited to one chipset or one manufacturer. It also doesn't seem to impact 400 or 500-series motherboards.

#Solution:

Update the BIOS. I don't know which BIOS version fixes this issue however after I updated the BIOS to the latest version on the machine I had access to, the issue disappeared and Windows 10 updated to version 20H2 via Windows Update.

Source of the solution (includes links to other threads about this issue): ",psa using series motherboard old bios may need update bios order install update window h h know post subreddit however support version ended feel important bring information attention anyone using series motherboard might noticed window installation failed update one later major version therefore longer receiving update including security update first learned issue month ago asked help series motherboard refused update symptom attempting upgrade version later window earlier result error xc though also seen error update history also able install window h h booting using installation medium freeze window logo restart affected hardware looking post issue seems affected machine one thing common series motherboards old bios impossible say affect series motherboards seem limited one chipset one manufacturer also seem impact series motherboards solution update bios know bios version fix issue however updated bios latest version machine access issue disappeared window updated version h via window update source solution includes link thread issue

1,500,0,93,1,"Please don't overhype RDNA 3 based on ridiculous rumorsHey!

So those of you who follow tech news like I do probably heard some ridiculous rumors about RDNA 3 being 2.5-3x faster then the 6900XT. We always hear such silly things about upcoming products early on and as we get closer to the release date rumors tend to get more realistic and accurate. If you look at the past few GPU generations, the trends are pretty clear, every generations GPUs get about 30-50% faster, there are outliers sometimes like Pascal was (and RDNA 3 can certainly be one of these) but mostly the trend holds.

So the current rumors about top RDNA 3 is that it'll be a chiplet based GPU with 2 80CU dies. Sounds very exciting and if this will probably be the biggest uplift in performance we'll see between 2 generations in a long while. But it still won't be 2.5-3x faster.

So first off: double the CU double the performance right? Well not really, scaling is never linear. Now you can make up for some of a performance lost with IPC gains of clock speed increases.

There's a problem with that however: On the current node with the current architecture if you were to have 2 80CU dies it would have a TDP of 600W since the 6900XT has a TDP of 300W and has 80CUs. Now AMD promised a 50% perf/watt upgrade over RDNA2 , but even if all that goes towards lowering power consumption (so no significant IPC increase) you're still looking at 450W of TDP if you don't lower clock speeds. I don't think AMD will want to release a 450W card, even 400W is pushing it so they'll probably have to decrease the clock speeds a little to keep power consumption in check which means additional performance loss.

And then there's the problem of latency which a chiplet based design will introduce and usually this has a very detrimental effect on gaming performance. Now technologies like infinity cache and 3D stacked cache can help with this to some extent so it's possible that the performance loss won't be too severe but it would be unrealistic to expect that there would be none at all.

And even if AMD can fix ALL these problems: Create a product that almost scales perfectly with the increase of compute units, outdo themselfs in terms of the perf/watt increase and do way above the promised 50% and keep current clock speeds without TDP getting out of hand, and completely fix the latency issue introduced by chiplets you're still ""only"" looking at double the performance not 2.5-3x. 

And don't get me wrong, if that happens RDNA 3 will be the most AMAZING generation we've seen in like 10+ years when it comes to the performance uplift over the previous generation, it's greater that what Pascal had over Maxwell and will surely beat Nvidias Lovelace (unless they too will go with an MCM design, then we'll see). But people would still be dissapointed because of these stupid rumors.

Now I'm sure there will be way it'll be 2.5-3x faster: The 3090 has 3x the TFLOPs the 2080 Ti has yet it's only \~50% faster in gaming. Ray-Tracing performance still has long ways to go especially for AMD, I'm sure there huge improvements can and will be made with the release of the next generation. RDNA 3 can be improved in ways to gain additional performance improvements over RDNA 2 using FSR. But from what I heard from these ""leakers"" they clarified that they don't mean 3x ray-tracing performance, they mean standard rasterization performance, which just won't happen.

I wrote this post to keep expectations in check, I'd love to be surprised but I don't want people to be dissapointed even if this is the most amazing product we'll se in a long while. Also, if these rumors were true, just imagine the prices... if anything will ever kill PC gaming, normalizing the current GPU prices will surely get the job done but that's a topic for another day...",please overhype rdna based ridiculous rumorshey follow tech news like probably heard ridiculous rumor rdna x faster xt always hear silly thing upcoming product early get closer release date rumor tend get realistic accurate look past gpu generation trend pretty clear every generation gpus get faster outlier sometimes like pascal rdna certainly one mostly trend hold current rumor top rdna chiplet based gpu cu dy sound exciting probably biggest uplift performance see generation long still x faster first double cu double performance right well really scaling never linear make performance lost ipc gain clock speed increase problem however current node current architecture cu dy tdp w since xt tdp w cu amd promised perf watt upgrade rdna even go towards lowering power consumption significant ipc increase still looking w tdp lower clock speed think amd want release w card even w pushing probably decrease clock speed little keep power consumption check mean additional performance loss problem latency chiplet based design introduce usually detrimental effect gaming performance technology like infinity cache stacked cache help extent possible performance loss severe unrealistic expect none even amd fix problem create product almost scale perfectly increase compute unit outdo themselfs term perf watt increase way promised keep current clock speed without tdp getting hand completely fix latency issue introduced chiplets still looking double performance x get wrong happens rdna amazing generation seen like year come performance uplift previous generation greater pascal maxwell surely beat nvidias lovelace unless go mcm design see people still dissapointed stupid rumor sure way x faster x tflops ti yet faster gaming ray tracing performance still long way go especially amd sure huge improvement made release next generation rdna improved way gain additional performance improvement rdna using fsr heard leaker clarified mean x ray tracing performance mean standard rasterization performance happen wrote post keep expectation check love surprised want people dissapointed even amazing product se long also rumor true imagine price anything ever kill gaming normalizing current gpu price surely get job done topic another day

1,91,0,3,0,"6900 XT underperforming compared to bench marksI just got this 6900XT I clean installed the drivers using DDU but it seems to struggle at preforming as much as other bench marks say so, Even when comparing the old 2080ti footage of warzone I got in comparison to the 6900 XT it scores lower FPS then the 2080ti, But that can be because of the map from cold war, I'm just curious if I've been misguided by benchmarks or if anyone else is having the same issues as well as if anyone knows any direct fixes, I might be missing.

I've been through a long chain of AMD chips (and Intel too...) and I wasn't quite sure what sort of an upgrade this would be.  I'd been running a 3900x in my home server and was mostly looking for the extra cores and threads that the 5950x offers.  But I wasn't prepared for the improved all around performance, even in single-threaded applications.  

As compared to Zen 2, the Zen 3 chip is an absolute monster - as a rule, I tend to slightly undervolt my server chips for cooler running and longer life.  And in the same X570 motherboard and with the same 240mm AIO cooler, it runs 100s of MHz faster, with 1/3rd more cores and 1/3rd more threads.  And better instructions per clock cycle to boot.  With a -0.2v voltage adjustment and with PBO on, at least a handful of the cores still hit 5.0ghz in single or lightly threaded applications.  Did I mention it also runs an avg of 5-10c cooler under load?  

As someone that's been building PCs since the K6 days, this might be one of the most surprising generation on generation updates I've seen.

1,10,0,0,0,"A Very Uncommon Battlestation&amp;#x200B;



Wanted to add a semi-unique battlestation, featuring an open-chassis Alienware Graphics Amplifier.

I have the benefit of being able to use one system for both work and gaming, but therefore need it to be portable when I need to go on-site. The overlap of being a developer and a gamer is that strong internals benefit both my personal and professional life, with the only difference in components being a powerful gaming GPU.

Unfortunately, Alienware didn't offer this model with a high-end Ryzen CPU (or a Threadripper), although they have started offering a Ryzen M15—albeit without the Alienware Graphics Amplifier eGPU dock, which is crucial to my setup, so it was a non-starter.

System specs:

* Alienware Area-51M R2 laptop
* Intel 10900K (10c/20t)
* 64 GB Crucial Ballistix DDR @ 2933 MHz, CL16 (Dell's motherboard can't do 3200 MHz reliably @ 64 GB, only at 32 GB—64 GB must require more electricity then the motherboard can handle reliably)
* 4x 1TB WD Blue SN550 NVMe disks; 1x OS, 2x in Windows Storage Spaces RAID 0 (striped) for improved r\\w performance (Personal/game disks), 1x work
* Intel UHD 630 (iGPU on the 10900K)
* AMD Radeon RX 5700M (dGPU within the laptop)
* Alienware Graphics Amplifier eGPU (PCIe 3.0 4x direct connection to the CPU):
   * XFX Speedster MERC 319 RX 6900 XT
   * Corsair CX650M PSU

This laptop is really a desktop replacement, as it's usually a full-fledged 10900K (@ 125w), and not a laptop CPU. I get the benefit of portability and (essentially) desktop performance at almost no compromise aside from weight. In Time Spy, the CPU scores \~13K, the GPU \~19.5k, for a combined \~19k.

I think this is a pretty unique setup, as few people have (or use) the Alienware Graphics Amplifier, and it's been EOL'd. I spent a lot of time working on them to figure out recent issues with the new GPUs (RX 6000 &amp; RTX 3000 series), which started [here]( and has finally culminated in a bigger post: [The State of the Alienware Graphics Amplifier in 2021](",uncommon battlestation x b wanted add semi unique battlestation featuring open chassis alienware graphic amplifier benefit able use one system work gaming therefore need portable need go site overlap developer gamer strong internals benefit personal professional life difference component powerful gaming gpu unfortunately alienware offer model high end ryzen cpu threadripper although started offering ryzen albeit without alienware graphic amplifier egpu dock crucial setup non starter system spec alienware area r laptop intel k c gb crucial ballistix ddr mhz cl dell motherboard mhz reliably gb gb gb must require electricity motherboard handle reliably x tb wd blue sn nvme disk x o x window storage space raid striped improved r w performance personal game disk x work intel uhd igpu k amd radeon rx dgpu within laptop alienware graphic amplifier egpu pcie x direct connection cpu xfx speedster merc rx xt corsair cx psu laptop really desktop replacement usually full fledged k w laptop cpu get benefit portability essentially desktop performance almost compromise aside weight time spy cpu score k gpu k combined k think pretty unique setup people use alienware graphic amplifier eol spent lot time working figure recent issue gpus rx rtx series started finally culminated bigger post state alienware graphic amplifier

1,47,0,4,0,"Super Resolution for Dummies?I've been hearing about Super Resolution for a while now, and I still haven't really found a ""Super Resolution 101"" guide. I've looked up articles, I've been to the AMD page on it, I've visited forums, and I still have a bunch of questions. Maybe you guys can answer them:

1) Okay, so how exactly does this work? 

From what I understand, the idiot's guide to DLSS would be ""the card uses machine learning to cut corners when it comes to filling in graphics, freeing up space for higher framerates."" From what I've seen of it, it's pretty darn impressive. FSR, to quote AMD, ""uses cutting-edge upscaling technologies to help boost your framerates..."" pretend I'm an idiot (which I am when it comes to this stuff) -- what does that mean? As I understand, no machine learning will be used with FSR. What are the upsides and downsides to that? 

2) What kind of a performance bump should be realistically expected? 

Someday soon the availability gods will smile upon me and I'll become part of the PS5 family. Right now most games on the PS5 can do ""performance"" (checkerboarded 4k, usually with no RT, at 60 fps), or ""quality"" (4k with RT at 30 fps). With FSR, would we be looking at true 4k at 60 fps? 4k/60 with ray tracing? 120 fps options for certain games? 

3) So, does this thing Skynet itself into existing machines and start upscaling everything, or will it only be available for certain titles? 

Will there be a huge balance patch type-deal when FSR goes live and bam, your computer/console has FSR now, enjoy the boosting, or will we have to wait for FSR-supported games that will recognize existing AMD chips and go from there? From what I can tell, it certainly looks like it's the latter, but I'm not sure. Also, how hard will this thing be to implement? Will upcoming titles like Horizon: Forbidden West be able to use it, or will it just be for games that aren't in production yet? 

4) What questions am I forgetting to ask, and how excited should I be about this? 

It's my first post on this Reddit and I really am pretty stupid with this stuff despite trying to do all the research I can, so please don't yell at me too much. Hope y'all are having a good Sunday.",super resolution dummy hearing super resolution still really found super resolution guide looked article amd page visited forum still bunch question maybe guy answer okay exactly work understand idiot guide dl card us machine learning cut corner come filling graphic freeing space higher framerates seen pretty darn impressive fsr quote amd us cutting edge upscaling technology help boost framerates pretend idiot come stuff mean understand machine learning used fsr upside downside kind performance bump realistically expected someday soon availability god smile upon become part p family right game p performance checkerboarded k usually rt fps quality k rt fps fsr looking true k fps k ray tracing fps option certain game thing skynet existing machine start upscaling everything available certain title huge balance patch type deal fsr go live bam computer console fsr enjoy boosting wait fsr supported game recognize existing amd chip go tell certainly look like latter sure also hard thing implement upcoming title like horizon forbidden west able use game production yet question forgetting ask excited first post reddit really pretty stupid stuff despite trying research please yell much hope good sunday

I'm building a PC that will act as both a gaming platform and as a personal workstation. I make 1080p Youtube videos, among other things. I use the Adobe Creative Suite; especially photoshop, aftereffects, and premiere pro.

Getting a graphics card is kind of a clown show at the moment. My overall budget is about two or two and a half grand. If I can get a decent card within a month or so for a price that doesn't cost the down payment of an old honda civic, I'd rather do that.

My plan is to get the rest of the system together and use the integrated graphics of the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X until I can source a GPU for my use case. I figure that I can put up with game settings that leave my eyes unmelted for a month or so. But I haven't seen if Adobe's Creative Suite runs with AMD integrated graphics. They officially support a spate of Intel integrated graphics, but no official confirmation of AMD.

I struggled to decide between the Ryzen 7 3700X and the Ryzen 5 5600X and am super happy I opted for the latter - this proc is ridiculous and I threw a Corsair H100i on it to keep it cool.  
I topped it off with 32GB of Crucial Ballistix DDR4-3600 RAM, a few CoolerMaster MF120 fans, a Seasonic Focus GX750 PSU, and a Sabrent 1TB Rocket Plus NVMe 4.0 M.2 SSD all tucked into a Thermaltake S100 Snow Edition case.   
It did take a BIOS update before the XMP Profile would actually work for clocking the RAM at 3600 - before the update it wouldn't even boot with the XMP Profile enabled. But I was still happy I didn't need a previous gen proc in order to boot in the first place - the board was on a new enough version already to support Zen3. AMD Precision Boost Overdrive was easy enough to turn on. I still have a little bit of tweaking to do for the GPU though to see what luck I have with undervolting and overclocking.  
I'm still trying to snag a better GPU, at which point I might switch to a custom loop for cooling, but for now, it'll do everything I need at 1440p. Might throw a storm trooper logo on the front of the case too, seems to be a nice black and white theme.

I've been on Macbook Pro for almost a decade, decided to switch to PC because I'm due for an upgrade but not willing to early adopt Apple Silicon until all my apps are native.

I recently ordered a 6800xt Midnight Black and EVGA 3070 Ti FTW3 Ultra, neither are in hand yet but shipping soon. I have no other components at the moment and I'm looking to build around one of these cards.

I'll be using the build for gaming and streaming, and I'm also a video editor and edit 4k in Premiere and Resolve frequently.

I got the 6800xt at reference price. I'm paying \~$100cad more for the 70Ti. If I were just purely gaming, I'd have no reservations just going with the 6800xt, but because of my other needs, I'm having a hard time deciding which card to go with. Planning on pairing either one with a 5900x, 32gb ram.

I understand Nvidia is better at encoding and has some optimization with Premiere (cuda), NVENC for streaming etc, but is the difference worth going with a more expensive but ""lower"" performing card?

There's also ray tracing and DLSS which aren't as important to me, but would be nice to have.

Any thoughts appreciated!

1,14,0,1,0,"Power supply thoughts (again...)It's probably been done to death, but - no matter how I do math, I can't figure out why PSU's are so consistently oversized.

A Radeon 6800 XT draws 280-ish watts when running all out without OC, and the Ryzen 5900X I'm pairing it with is more like 130 watts (again, not OC). 

That's under 450 watts. Even if we factor in 50 watts for the mobo and a couple of M.2 drives, a 500 watt PSU should work (albeit be far from ideal) and a 660 watt be plenty. 

The reason I'm pondering this is because I have an existing Seasonic Prime 660 and a Focus 850 - and I trust the Prime more. 

So guess we'll see, I'll slap the 660 in there and turn on the power. I can't see how it would be undersized in any way for a basic air-cooled system as specified.

1,8,0,1,0,"ECC on 5800X, Gigabyte B550IAnother post about ECC on Ryzen, plus a few other comments. Linux (Fedora 34) only.

A month ago I did a system upgrade:

- Gigabyte B550I Auros Pro AX
- 5800X
- 2 x Kingston KSM32ED8/16HD dual-rank 2Rx8 ECC unbuffered RAM

This didn't go well; I could not get it to boot (initially the OS installer,
then into the BIOS at all). On talking to the retailer ([kingstonmemoryshop.co.uk])
they recommended returning this RAM and buying KSM32ES8/16ME (16GB single rank 1Rx8)
instead. These work perfectly (and the retailer gave a full refund on the 2Rx8 memory).

I can report that ECC is enabled (according to `dmidecode`) and that the system
has been running stably for the last month. I have not tried overclocking.


### Gigabyte B550I Aorus Pro Ax

This board I ended up keeping but **do not recommend**. I experienced three
issues with it:

1.  The CMOS reset jumpers do not appear to work no matter how I tried (shorting
    with a screwdriver as suggested or using a jumper). The manual does lists a
    second reset method, unplugging the coin cell for one minute. This works but
    is a huge pain to do, thanks to that integrated I/O shield: you must
    uninstall the board, remove several screws from the back, then carefully pry
    off the shield. This basically means I dare not try any overclocking setting
    which could possibly prevent the system from booting (especially since
    builds are more difficult in mini-ITX cases).
2.  The 2.5G network port is terrible. My TPLink ethernet-over-powerline
    adapters started disconnecting from when I first tried using the system.
    Sounds bizarre, but [this thread][2] includes similar reports. This resulted
    in intermittent drops (a few per hour), though recently I haven't been able
    to get it to work at all. It is now disabled in BIOS and I am using a
    cheap USB3 1G adapter (which works but with some errors in `dmesg`).
3.  I cannot get the built-in wifi to work (on Linux). Others reportedly have.
    I haven't put much effort in, but also haven't found much to go on (some
    vague messages in `dmesg` which Google found some similar reports for, but
    only for add-in wifi cards).


### 5800x CPU

It's fast (vaguely 3x over my old Xeon 1231), but you already know that.

Load power usage and temperature can get high (apparently 90C is normal). The
5800x has much higher power/TDP limits than the 5600x — 105W vs 65W — but to
what end? The CPU automatically scales voltage and frequency based on demand and
various limits, but at the high end there does not appear to be much difference:
forcing ""65W TDP"" limits (via BIOS ""eco mode"" under overclocking settings)
results in much lower load temperature (~60C) with very little change in
single-thread or multi-thread performance.

Idle temperatures and fan speeds are higher than I'd expected. Looking more
closely at reviews, it seems that recent AMD desktop CPUs use very roughly 20W
at idle vs 10W for Intel CPUs. (APUs appear much better: they are derived from
the monolithic mobile designs.) According to [this article][1], the memory
controller is largely to blame. Perhaps, then, lower RAM speeds can reduce idle
power usage.

But that's not all: your OS may background jobs from time to time. This Ryzen
CPU scales frequency quickly, thus a single-threaded background job can easily
use most of the CPU's power budget if nothing else is going on. So far I've yet
to find a way of limiting CPU scaling when the only active processes are
low-priority.

I watched the latest episode of The Bring Up, and in the [notes at the end]( there was a more complete list of FSR supported hardware than I saw before:

While the ""if the minimum requirements of the game are met"" possibly means that FSR might not be relevant right now (that is, on the 22nd), it's still interesting to note that FSR is expected to work well on a weak integrated GPU.

I still wonder why the RX 460 has been left out, considering that iGPUs are supported as well as the entire 500 family, which includes the 560 and 550.

1,15,0,1,0,"Run 3900X coolHi,

I'm running a 3900X desktop in a fairly small office. I'm looking at ways to reduce the heat output of my 3900X - when I'm not running heavy workloads; which is most of the time. I've done what I can to make the office vent better with furniture placement and fans, so I'm focusing my attention on the PC.

To be clear: The PC is running cool itself (the Noctua fans are doing their job), but that heat needs to go somewhere and it's making the room super hot. This is not about thermal distribution cooling solutions inside the PC.

I have tried a few things to negligible effect:

* Underclocked the CPU
* Turned off SMT
* Turned off one of the CCDs
* Reduced the power rating for the GPU 

Specs:

Was just starting my guild wars 2 weekend and suddenly pc goes poof and turns off, tried to power back on and it beeps for GPU error.
My now 4 year old rx480 just up and died. At the worst possible time to do so.

Current setup is: R5 1600, prime B350-plus, 16gb ddr4

Locally, my options for a new part are:
Gt 1030 2gb for $220
R5 3200g $125
R5 3400g $210

The used market is even worse, gtx 750 are about $200.. 

I'm leaning heavily towards 3200g as a temporary solution for about a year or two, since 3200 benchmarks very close to 1030 but is cheaper to get.

Would love to get some opinions on this.

So who makes AMD's reference cards?

It's actually PC Partner Group, the company that sell video cards under the ZOTAC brand.

If you look at engineering samples of AMD's cards from the last 10 years or so, you'll see that they have stickers labeling them as products of ""PC Partner Ltd.""



PC Partner is, in fact, the largest contract manufacturer of AMD cards.



There is another misconception that PC Partner owns Sapphire.

This is also false.

As mentioned by Sapphire's own CEO, PC Partner is contracted to make Sapphire cards.



PC Partner manufactures products for a wide range of companies, such as Dell, AMD, Acer, Samsung, Sapphire, LG, Microsoft.



Saying that PC Partner Group owns Sapphire would be like saying that Foxconn owns TUL Corporation (the company that sell video cards under the PowerColor brand).

I know there was an driver issue which caused brightness flickering, but this was solved afterwards. But I still experience it when turning on Freesync.

To have brightness flickering in loading screen is normal, because of flapping FPS, but I have it ingame aswell. I tried several games and have flickering although I'm in the Freesync range of 48 - 164 Hz.

I'm unsing a VESA certified DP 1.4 cable and when turning off freesync all looks fine.  


Am I doing something wrong or is there still an ongoing issue with that.

(disclaimer) In a world where the [AMD.com]( prices are, as the mods of r/amd see it, objective, and where the price you actually have to pay is an entirely subjective issue, (/disclaimer)

How much of the AMD GPU's inflation do you think is due to AMD marketing pratices? I'm curious in what you have to say about the organized shortages, the paper realeases, etc - comparing before pandemic and present condition. Did you experience another situation where the price you have to pay is triple the supposed price of the card?  In clear, don't we have a sort of trend here?Could other marketing practices change the price for their long time supporters - the gamers - had to pay to keep their online social life?

* The Division 2
* Destiny 2
* Final Fantasy XV

List of games in which RIS doesn't work after I noticed the issue:

* Apex
* Scavengers
* Hood: Outlaws &amp; Legends
* Deep Rock Galactic
* Pumpkin Jack
* Divinity: Original Sin 2
* Hellblade
* Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order

The only game in my current library that works with RIS is Dragon Quest XI.

I remember I was used to use RIS on other games like Nier: Automata and BioShock Remastered, but I don't have them installed at the moment. Might try.

1,13,0,1,0,"For people who are looking for XFX 5700 XT triple dissipation gpu blocks.I had a hard time initially trying to get a waterblock for my card and I was looking around to see if the usual suspects would have a block such as ekwb but they stopped selling them and ebay listings were not as clear as some just were thicc 2/3 for 300$. Eventually I found out that the 3 cards are all the same and the triple dissipation and thicc 2 are more similar in specs and layout. I got an alphacool block for xfx thicc 2 and it fit perfectly with no issues. Even the backplate fits.  

So if anyone is looking for a block for the XFX 5700 XT Triple Dissipation, the best fit is thicc 2 and from what I have seen all of the companies who made them or are still selling them from third parties are gonna fit even with the backplate. There are also some that give you the option of using the xfx backplate as well.


This is the block I purchased but they keep showing up with more.

1,24,0,1,0,"GPU choices in the current market pricingHi all!

I have a question for you all. Considering the current GPU pricing situation, I have noticed that for most NVidia cards and some of the lower-end AMD cards, prices are inflated beyond reason. However, the 6900XT seems to be one that stayed quite close to its MSRP, be it from retailers or in the reseller market.

For example/context, where I am, the 3080 can fetch upwards of EUR1500 with higher-end AIB models coming close to EUR2000. The 3090, despite being a poor value, to begin with, still sells for around EUR2200 with high-end models going upwards of EUR3000. 

So, question is, given similar/identical prices, would you buy a 3090/3080 or a 6900XT? So, say at a price of EUR2000, you can either get these ""Ultimate"" 6900XTs with the Navi 21XTXH die, or you can get some low-to-mid-range RTX3090s, or some high-end RTX3080s. Alternatively, if we consider the price of EUR1500, then you can either get low-to-mid-range 6900XT or mid-range RTX3080. Of course, the question concerns mainly the performance and features of the cards and their build quality. Aesthetic or design is less of a factor.

BSOD  
When I start my PC up and try and access any form of media whether  it's Youtube/twitch/game I get a blue screen Driver power state or something, But if i leave it for about 3 minutes then carry on its fine, almost as if it needs to heat up, this problem i can deal with as i say, if i start up then do something else i can carry on using my PC as normal without any blue screens.  


Audio Cutting out

pretty self explanatory, while playing games such as PUBG and Rocket League, my audio will cut out for as long as a second at various times, If i have a video playing on my second monitor the audio from that continues while the game would cut out.  


Driver Timeouts  
This one I've never seen until the past week, While gaming, Both monitors go black, (Audio continues) they both come back on after a few seconds and the game I'm playing has crashed as well as any video such as YT/Twitch, there's an error screen saying driver timeout and asking me to report it, (I have) I obviously have to restart the game and any video I'm watching in my browser (Chrome, if its relevant)

&amp;#x200B;

I recently plugged a disc drive in which involved Removing the GPU to access SATA ports (It's since been removed), no drops or anything to report, I took it out, I put it back in, I've been able to play games for quite a while and had no issues but then, a timeout out of nowhere, although the audio cutouts have been constantly happening throughout.  
Originally i was on 21.4.1 then I DDU'd in safe mode to 21.2.2, then I tried 21.3.1, now I'm back trying 21.4.1 after re-seating my GPU hoping there was a problem there, although all the connections were properly seated.  


I have had this whole setup for roughly a year and had zero problems,  I read about BIOS updates but surely if my PC has been perfect for a year that shouldn't be needed. I also read about the latest Windows update being a possible problem, as well as the GPU power supply and cables, they're the same ones I've been using for a year (6+2 X 2 connectors).

I did a lot of research to help myself, but didn't really get to the bottom of this. I have a Ryzen 5 3600 with a Scythe Mugen 5 Rev B cooler. It's not even 4 months old. First I used HW Info and it showed idle temps of 45-55 degrees with only Discord and a web browser open. While gaming it reached 70-80 degrees. I wasn't too worried because the case of the computer has one of these magnetic dust filters on top and when I put my hand above it, it's like putting it in a fridge. Now recently my game crashed and HW Info showed 95 degrees top temp. I tested the same scenario with Ryzen Master and played for 2 hours, with Ryzen Master not showing temps higher than 69 degrees. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question now is: Should I just trust the monitoring app provided by Ryzen and forget about HW Info or should I be concerned? Cinebench stresstest by the way didn't go any higher than 70 degrees.

**Specs / Settings**

* **Motherboard:** ASRock Master SLI x470 a/c
* **CPU:** 5800x
* **Cooler:** Noctua NH-D15
* **PBO:** Enabled (Advanced)
* **Curve Optimizer:** All-core, negative, 10
* **CPU Max Boost Clock:** \+100mhz

**CPU-Z Results:**   

**HWinfo Temps during CPU-Z Benchmark:**   

**Gaming Temps:**   

**Notes:** With these settings, I see regular boosts to 4.85ghz, 4.95ghz during gaming (with a 1.44v boost). The average voltage, clock speeds, and temps all seem fine to me, so I don't think seeing those kinds of spikes is a problem, but can someone confirm that? I know Ryzen chips love high voltages and all, but the 5800x seems to be on another level!

I can significantly reduce temps for only about a 3% loss in performance if I set a -50mv all-core vcore offset. But I don't see a reason to sacrifice performance if gaming temps are 50c and the system is stable with the settings above. 

Also, I could not go beyond a negative 10 all-core offset with curve optimizer. As soon as I tried -15, I would get reboots right after the benchmark. I also CAN boost to +200mhz with the negative 10 all-core offset, and there are no issues as far as I can tell, but I am not greedy and would rather play it safe. The performance gain versus a +100mhz offset is very minimal, so I will stick with +100mhz for now.",x overclocking already beastly cpu pbo curve optimizeri happy x far dropped old x board result incredible far want add mix spec setting motherboard asrock master sli x c cpu x cooler noctua nh pbo enabled advanced curve optimizer core negative cpu max boost clock mhz cpu z result hwinfo temp cpu z benchmark gaming temp note setting see regular boost ghz ghz gaming v boost average voltage clock speed temp seem fine think seeing kind spike problem someone confirm know ryzen chip love high voltage x seems another level significantly reduce temp loss performance set mv core vcore offset see reason sacrifice performance gaming temp c system stable setting also could go beyond negative core offset curve optimizer soon tried get reboots right benchmark also boost mhz negative core offset issue far tell greedy rather play safe performance gain versus mhz offset minimal stick mhz

Depending on the game of course, if it's a really demanding game than they usually stay on much longer.

When I'm not gaming (Zero RPM enabled) the gpu runs at 53C/57 junction (aio pump always stays on, fans off), if I disable Zero RPM altogether it's 25C/30 junction.

I guess my question is, should I just disable Zero RPM altogether and just let the fans run all the time?

What I've done so far in order to fix it: Scanned PC, Updated Windows, updated all drivers including deleting them via DDU and AMD cleanup Utility, tweaked BIOS and AMD Adrenaline, ran memtest, ran few other memory and GPU tests with no errors, re-seated ram and gpu, physically cleaned pc and parts, rolled back from Adrenaline 2021 to a more stable one from 2019, disabled CStates and Cool'n'Quiet mode, forced VSync on and off, tried removing each ram stick, and many others that I already forgot, nothing seems to have any impact.  


2 years ago I had a simillar problem regarding playing Witcher 3, my pc would also hard freeze, I remember I fixed it by making AMD Adrenaline force Vsync ON and then turning Vsync off in Witcher 3, but now those options wouldn't fix my problem, also problem occurs all the time, not because of a specific game.  


Specs:  
Win 10 64 Pro  
RX 570 8gb OC  
Ryzen 5 2400g with Vega graphics 11  
Corsair Vengeance 3200mhz 2x8gb + 2x4gb (24gb)  
Gigabyte AB350M - Gaming3  
Evga 600 W1  


I rolled back nearly everything to factory settings, Im not OCing. Pc and GPU will run perfectly so nothing seems to be damaged, the only problem are random hard freezes. Also my temps are stable.  


Event viewer shows only kernel errors, which aren't very helpful.

1,26,0,1,0,"5950X - Better performance with larger voltage offset?Hi all, I just got a 5950X yesterday and I've been experimenting with the voltages for a bit, mainly because compared to my previous 3900X (same TDP) it was making a lot more heat and spinning up my AIO fans more frequently even when idling. I've noticed that with PBO enabled (I only have PBO and not curve optimizer in my BIOS), the larger the negative voltage offset, the better the multi-core performance becomes. The CB23 scores are below:

&amp;#x200B;

All threads:

Stock: 25390

Offset -0.075V: 26056

Offset -0.1V: 26137

&amp;#x200B;

I also did some tests restricting the number of threads to 4 (most of the games I play only use 3-4 threads): 

Stock: 6069

Offset -0.025V: 6043

Offset -0.05V: 6040

Offset -0.075V: 6038

Offset -0.1V: 6068

&amp;#x200B;

Is this normal behaviour? I have the offset set to -0.1V now because it seems to give much lower temperatures while maintaining the same gaming performance, and even better all-core performance. I've had a look at other people's benchmarks and it seems that my CB23 scores (even the highest ones) are quite low. Any trick to get improve this without Curve Optimizer? 

I can't go any higher on TDC and EDC. Another thing I noticed is that with the 3900X, it was drawing 180W when benchmarking, but the 5950X is barely passing 140W total.",x better performance larger voltage offset hi got x yesterday experimenting voltage bit mainly compared previous x tdp making lot heat spinning aio fan frequently even idling noticed pbo enabled pbo curve optimizer bios larger negative voltage offset better multi core performance becomes cb score x b thread stock offset v offset v x b also test restricting number thread game play use thread stock offset v offset v offset v offset v x b normal behaviour offset set v seems give much lower temperature maintaining gaming performance even better core performance look people benchmark seems cb score even highest one quite low trick get improve without curve optimizer go higher tdc edc another thing noticed x drawing w benchmarking x barely passing w total

ASUS ROG Strix X570-I motherboard (and others) have had an annoyance: The PCH fan which is audible at 3.5k rpm and becomes a loud high pitch mosquito whine at higher speeds (which can reach higher than 6.5k rpm) (see [here]( for instance). The fan curve makes it climb to these high rpms even when temperatures are not very high (e.g., \~6.4k rpm @ 75 degrees). Many solutions have been tried, including modding the BIOS to enable editing the fan curve. This worked great until before BIOS version 3406 (AGESA 1.2.0.0) at which ASUS enforced only non-modded flashing for X570-I (X570-E and -F are not blocked yet). See related [post]( by modder *(in German)*.

A recent [post]( offered a way for editing a BIOS setting that helps prevent the chipset from getting too hot in the first place by enabling something called ASPM. This seems to help as some have reported. But did not keep the fan quiet enough for others, like me. But the method itself that was used was a great source of inspiration because it makes your brain pop this question: “Would it be possible to directly edit the PCH fan curve hidden in the bowels of the BIOS?” I embarked on a journey yesterday to answer it.

Like many BIOS fan curve settings that use lower-middle-upper specification points, the default PCH curve is specified by (55°,0%),(60°,40%),(93°,100%). A much quieter curve would need just one value changed (PCH Fan Middle Temperature: 60 -&gt; 80):

&amp;#x200B;



The following is how I did this change on my X570-I with BIOS version 3603 (that I recently upgraded to). And it worked!! The main caveat that needs attention is that the variable offset at which this setting needs to be written may vary depending on the BIOS version. So it is important to get the correct offset.

## Phase 1: Getting the correct variable offset for your BIOS

## Tools:

1. UEFITool: `UEFITool_NE_A58_win32.zip` from [
2. Universal IFR Extractor: [

## Steps:

* 1.  Locate your BIOS CAP file (or download it from ASUS)
* 2.  Load CAP file into UEFITool
* 3.  Ctrl-F to search and type “pch” in the Text tab:



* 4.  Export the found results to file `Section_PE32_image_Setup.sct`



* 5.  Load `Section_PE32_image_Setup.sct` into Universal IFR Extractor and click Extract to save the result to a text file:



* 6.  Search for “PCH Fan Middle Temperature” in the test file and write down the variable offset (**0x3A** in this example):



* Note it is a single byte value and it has a value of 0x3C (=60 decimal, the 60 degrees middle temperature value)

## Phase 2: Modifying the PCH curve in the BIOS

## Tools:

1. The efi file (`modGRUBShell.efi`) from release 1.3+ from [

## Steps:

* 1.  Format a USB drive (small is OK since we only need 3MB), making sure the file system is FAT32.
* 2.  On the USB drive, 
* a. Create directory `EFI` at the top 
* b. Create directory `BOOT` under `EFI` 
* c. Copy `modGRUBShell.efi` under `EFI\BOOT` and rename it to: `bootx64.efi`
* 3.  Reboot and enter BIOS, and from the Boot menu, boot using the USB drive. Selecting the USB drive under Boot Override (“UEFI: SanDisk, Partitions 1” in this example will do that):



* 4.  This should take you to `grub&gt;` prompt. Once, there, type: *(Warning: Your BIOS may need a different value than* `0x3a`*, depending on what was found in Phase 1)*  
`setup_var_cv QFan 0x3a`  
This does not change any setting; it just lets you see what is currently stored. You should see “`offset 0x3a is: 0x3c`” (`0x3c` being the current value, which is 60 in decimal indicating the middle temperature setting). If you don’t see this, something is not right and you may want to stop here.
* 5.  **We are now ready to make the change**. To do this, type: *(Warning: Your BIOS may need a different value than* `0x3a`*, depending on what was found in Phase 1)*  
`setup_var_cv QFan 0x3a 0x01 0x50`  
which means change variable `0x3a` within the `QFan` Varstore to value `0x50` (80 in decimal). The `0x01` means it is a one byte change. Steps 4 and 5 should look like this screenshot:



* 6.  The change is now made. But for it to take effect, you must hard boot. Hold the power key until the computer shuts down then power it back up. 
* 7.

I recently upgraded my ref cooling to Alphacool Eisfolf 2 AiO and decided if was time to finalize a setting and never touch it again.

I'll post a screenshot with all the details but here's the basics of it. I know this is limited to every specific chip and board. My GPU isnt a great overclocker but it's also dead silent with no coil whine or VRM buzz.

1,17,0,1,0,"GPU Shortages, AM5, and the future: discussion on buildingHello everyone, just a rando PC fan.

About 6\~ weeks ago, I placed an order on a respected PC builder website for a 3060/3900x PC build (for editing, more VRAM is great, and the 12 core CPU is also). Anyways, Initially I was quoted around a 4 week wait, but I feel like the situation is getting worse, and they did recently offer to replace the 3060 for a 2060 for a discount (no way, never!) to speed up builds.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, what I've had the time to think about, after considering all this, is if I should just cancel it. I mean, I \*have\* a ASUS G14 with a 6 GB 2060 and an 8-core 4900HS... After waiting so long, and really, still being able to still get the work done I need (and gaming ofc), would it not just better at this point to cancel it and wait for the AM5 CPUs?  


Now, I know this is an age old question about ""should I wait"", but think it's worth a revist, simply due to GPUs not existing. Considering the fact that GPU prices are high, stocks are ultra low, and the fact that this is the last (?) AM4 generation CPUs, do all these factors push you towards waiting a year, in order to give a chance to:  


a) Alleviate GPU supply issues  
b) Have new GPU generations anyways   
c) Invest into a new AMD socket, giving you multiple more years of upgrades  
d) get into DDR5, possibly?  
e) FSR incoming, my main push to NVIDIA is DLSS, not RTX (that's the ""lose half frame rate"" button). If AMD is proposing a solution to boost frame rates like DLSS, I have no trouble going for AMD GPUs now, as they naturally offer higher VRAMs anyways (yay video editing!).

&amp;#x200B;

On its own, the AM5 may not have pushed me, but with all the other things happening, I'm now considering putting in a refund and cancelling my order.

When I set PBO to enabled in BIOS nothing changes, I only get a boost when I use the EDC 1 bug but apparently this is not considered safe since it disables the high current detection.

With PBO enabled, on auto or with custom PPT, TDC and EDC values other than EDC 1 I get exactly the same scores and clocks as with PBO disabled. Shouldn't I see at least a little change?

With the EDC bug I get around 100 MHz higher all-core boost and around 50 MHz higher single-core boost. This translates to around 40 points higher CB15 MT scores and 3-4 points higher ST scores. Voltage during all-core loads is around 1.32-1.33 Volts when using this bug.

Have I missed some other setting to get PBO to work right? Does anyone here maybe have experience with Ryzen 3000 PBO on this board?

CTR rates my processor as a golden sample and gets me 4.4 GHz all-core at 1.25 Volts so PBO should definitely do something, right? On stock I get all-core boosts to around 4.275 GHz.

1,12,0,1,0,"Choosing the best AMD processor for my systemHi there AMD Subreddit, I come to you with an issue.

So I have a cybperpower pre-built that was given to me as a gift a year ago (I know, I know), and I'm now getting around to upgrading it. 

Already with 16gb of DDR4 ram I'm seeing performance improvements, but with the GPU price situation currently a CPU is my best bet for further upgradability. I'm stuck with my RX 570. 

It has one of these ASrock A230m-HDV motherboards that won't let me overclock, so as far as that goes I'm looking for the best bang for the buck CPU options. As much as I'd love to go all out and get a new motherboard, my confidence in installing a motherboard isn't quite there yet.  

The system preforms great besides the constant CPU backlog. The Ryzen 3 2300X in it currently is working its heart out trying to catch up. I have it running on ultimate performance and with all the normal performance tweaks I can find online.  

Eventually I'll rebuild the system entirely, since I'm someone who doesn't believe in spending a ton of money for a case when I think the insides are more important. 

Any advice here would help!",choosing best amd processor systemhi amd subreddit come issue cybperpower pre built given gift year ago know know getting around upgrading already gb ddr ram seeing performance improvement gpu price situation currently cpu best bet upgradability stuck rx one asrock hdv motherboards let overclock far go looking best bang buck cpu option much love go get motherboard confidence installing motherboard quite yet system preforms great besides constant cpu backlog ryzen x currently working heart trying catch running ultimate performance normal performance tweak find online eventually rebuild system entirely since someone believe spending ton money case think inside important advice help

1,17,0,1,0,"Faulty RX 5600xtHi guys, I just need to know if anyone else has experienced the same problems I have been experiencing with my RX 5600xt. 

Lately, I have needed to undervolt it because on its default settings it would randomly crash under light loads such as playing VALORANT. 

I am getting increasingly frustrated because it is so inconsistent. I have to constantly tweak my settings--mainly voltage and fan speed--because I cannot find the right settings to keep it running smoothly. 

I noticed that when it crashes, temp is usually 60 C and above.

What happens during crashes is either one of the following:
1. The screen just goes black and the PC restarts on its own
2. Everything freezes and the last sound cue plays over and over again until I have to unplug the power supply and replug it just to reboot.

I have already tried all the solutions given in AMD forums such as update drivers, reinstall drivers with DDU, etc. etc.

I need help on this because I would hate to have to spend a fortune on another graphics card just so I can play and stream in peace.",faulty rx xthi guy need know anyone else experienced problem experiencing rx xt lately needed undervolt default setting randomly crash light load playing valorant getting increasingly frustrated inconsistent constantly tweak setting mainly voltage fan speed cannot find right setting keep running smoothly noticed crash temp usually c happens crash either one following screen go black restarts everything freeze last sound cue play unplug power supply replug reboot already tried solution given amd forum update driver reinstall driver ddu etc etc need help hate spend fortune another graphic card play stream peace

1,12,0,1,0,"CTR crashing my PC during AVX light test phase 2Reference:

CPU: Ryzen 5 5600X

Mobo: Gigabyte Aorus B550 Elite V2

Cooler: Arctic Liquid Freezer II 360 Revision 4

&amp;#x200B;

Here I was happy I finally installed my new cooler and would finally get some extra performance with CTR.

Alas, as usual I am met with the fact that reality is disappointing.

&amp;#x200B;

The program itself seems to not know what kind of CPU I have, as it cannot make up it's mind whether it's a bronze, silver or gold CPU.

&amp;#x200B;

So far it seems to add values seemingly randomly, as my current post-crash profile which it created indicates that my Ryzen 5 5600X should be running at 5050Mhz on High PX profile. There is obviously no way this CPU is capable of running at 5050Mhz even with a full blast load temp of 47 degrees and choked full of voltage.

&amp;#x200B;

It looks like it's doing something until it reaches AVX Light load testing, at which point it finishes the first test, starts the second test and immediately reboots my PC. This renders the entire diagnostic obsolete so far.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I tried going to Advanced mode and setting the diagnostic voltage from 1187mV to 1225mV which only seemed to have given a massive increase to PX High speeds but continued in crashing before finishing the diagnostics.

I also tried setting the polling rate to 1500.

Also pretty funny how it thinks my CPU goes over 5GHz when the max frequency in the advanced settings is set as 4900Mhz.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I'm not sure what the issue is. I set my vdroop settings to High as instructed after loading optimized defaults, and my memory only has XMP active (altho even without XMP it still crashes).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After months of trying to get a graphic card at a reasonable price, I was able to purchase an RX 6800XT off of the AMD store on June 3rd. But the invoice and the order number did not show up for hours and made me worried. So I contacted AMD support and was told not to worry about it. It will ship soon, but the next day after getting the order confirmation email, AMD decided to cancel my order with the reason listed as ""Other"" and ruin my whole day.

After getting in touch with the support, they could not find the exact reason behind the cancelation and asked me to place another order! The support's main idea behind the cancelation was maybe an anti-fraud measure triggered by the system. But the transaction went through PayPal without any issue. All the address information and billing information on my account is confirmed. Also the payment processor, Digital River, has no clue why the order got canceled. They suggested contacting AMD for a solution.

Now the question is how I am going to place another order when there is no stock? If there is a problem with an order, why not contacting the buyer? Instead of just canceling the order.

I have seen many scalpers and bots getting multiple cards from AMD without a single problem, but I can't have one card as an average gamer. How is this fair?

Has anyone had their order canceled by AMD and found a solution? Are there any mods here that can help?

CPU: Ryzen 5800x  
Cooler: Noctua NH-D15  
Case: Cooler Master H500P Mesh (meh) with an additional Noctua 140mm fan on the top as Intake  


I've looked into undervolting in order to get lower temps, I was going on 90C running a MC Cinebench R23, I know that 5800x is a hot boi but those temps were too high for me. (If you want to know the score, I don't have it, I've never ended a run due to reaching 90C)  


So I've undervolted with PBO in the bios, setting all cores negative curve with a value of 25 in the Curve Optimizer Magnitude field;  
Now I'm on 84C running a MC Cinebench R23, with a score of 15798 and clocks between 4849-4851 Mhz;  
On a single-core run I've scored 1603 Pts at 49-51C;  


Now I'm curious about 2 things:  
1) I've heard that in MSI Bios every unit in the Curve Optimizer Magnitude field equals to 3 to 5 Millivolts, is It the same in the Aorus Bios?  
2) Someone had the same issues/went through the same procedure? What values Have you put? Did you set the curve for all cores or have you set different values per core(s) ?

1,0,0,1,0,"Hardware Leak Tracker - The Who's Who of Leaks[Link to spreadsheet at the bottom of this post]

I thought I'd share my own work that I've been doing in determining who is a good leaker and who isn't, based on the claims they've made and whether or not they come true or not. 

It took me many months to compile all the data and I wanted to be able to know without a doubt who are the 'guess-timators' pulling numbers out of the air, who actually have consistent and reliable sources, and who is just following the trends and using their own analysis to try to cut through the weeds.

While it may seem like it's a very subjective whether someone is making a claim or not, or whether someone it just speculating, or just making discussion, etc, I put together a set of very strict rules as to how I count claims and also how I verify them. The rules are listed in the summary of results tab so you can look at them and see how the data is represented.

In the end, the idea was to simply score each leaker by the % of the number of claims they got right.

The data covers all leaks that have been made by each of the known sources, as far back as I could go. For some leakers this data stretches all the way back to before the Zen1 years. For most twitter leakers, this only goes back to 2018 or so.

I know that there are still some very popular leakers out there that I haven't covered. But honestly, doing only a couple channels was hard enough going through all the videos (but it was fun/cringey sometimes as well). I don't want to go through like 4 or 5 more channels..it's just simply too much time, and, honestly, I hadn't planned on sharing this project except for maybe the results page. But here it is anyway. 

I also hadn't added any well-known forum leakers, as that is a huge mess going through posts that are scattered all over the place. So mainly it's just twitter, Youtube, and some specific websites.

The last time I updated the sheet for new leaks was sometime in the beginning of Feb 2021, so new leaks since then have not been added. However, I have just gone through all of the leaks that were added before then and verified any that could be verified, so it is an up-to-date account of the leaks, verified against the information that we have from products that have been released up to today.

The results speak for themselves. You can dig into the data page as well to see specific leaks that have been verified. I should also note that leaks that are behind a paywall have been hidden, but are still counted in the results page.

I won't be updating the list anymore, so this is the Who's Who as of Feb 2021. Some people have gotten better at leaking, some have gotten worse, some have just remained bad. But I hope everyone can use this to determine who is and isn't dependable when it comes to spilling the beans, and be able to make a decision for themselves whether a leak is likely to be true or not, at least in part, based on who is the one doing the leaking.

If anyone wants to take this data and make a cool looking spreadsheet or infographic, be my guest.

1,9,0,1,0,"Opinion: AMD great jump in HPC space should be better Windows driver, NOT W6800 or Instinct MI100So, these days, more and more information about the W6800 is flying around. I have followed AMD and been on this sub for long enough to conclude that: absolutely nothing will change.

Nvidia will keep their name on Workstation, HPC, ML if AMD keeps doing what they are doing, which is basically giving the middle finger to the professional Windows user space. From the bug-full Radon ProRender for the W6800 line to the ""up-yours-Windows"" ROCm development platform for AMD Instinct.

It has been said times to time that since Windows held most of the PC market, if new comers approach their work with a Nvidia product, they will likely to keep using Nvidia product. However, apart from AMD's inability or unwillingness to work with Windows, there is also a Linux cult that echoed AMD's action by valid arguments like: ""Windows suck"", ""If you want real work, use Linux"", ""HPC is for Linux. Period"".

Like how has the result been for AMD with that logic so far? As an IT engineer myself, I would say in our fields, there are many talents people. However, they are so talented that they are blinded by their ego, and basically say ""f\*\*\*-you"" to any other opinion. Yes, ""technically"", HPC works better with Linux, but not everything is about ""technical"".

I am not saying that if AMD spends time on expanding Windows driver and compatibility for HPC GPUs product, they can dethrone Nvidia. However, seeing that HPC is more focus on Linux by both companies, if AMD spends more time optimizing for Windows, at least they have a chance as they are fighting on a new battlefield.",opinion amd great jump hpc space better window driver w instinct mi day information w flying around followed amd sub long enough conclude absolutely nothing change nvidia keep name workstation hpc ml amd keep basically giving middle finger professional window user space bug full radon prorender w line window rocm development platform amd instinct said time time since window held market comer approach work nvidia product likely keep using nvidia product however apart amd inability unwillingness work window also linux cult echoed amd action valid argument like window suck want real work use linux hpc linux period like result amd logic far engineer say field many talent people however talented blinded ego basically say f opinion yes technically hpc work better linux everything technical saying amd spends time expanding window driver compatibility hpc gpus product dethrone nvidia however seeing hpc focus linux company amd spends time optimizing window least chance fighting battlefield

1,17,0,1,0,"I think Big Navi was just a proof of concept of AMD's MCM Active ChipletI was reading through AMD's patent filing for [active bridge chiplet with integrated cache]( when one snippit stuck out to me. 

""an active bridge chiplet 118 communicably couples the GPU chiplets 106 (i.e., GPU chiplets 106-1 through 106-N) to each other. Although three GPU chiplets 106 are shown in FIG. 1, the number of GPU chiplets in the chiplet array 104 is a matter of design choice and varies in other embodiments, such as described in more detail below. In various embodiments, such as discussed below in more detail with respect to FIG. 2, the active bridge chiplet 118 includes an active silicon bridge that serves as a high-bandwidth die-to-die interconnect between GPU chiplet dies. Additionally, the active bridge chiplet 118 operates as a memory crossbar with a shared, unified last level cache (LLC) to provide inter-chiplet communications and to route cross chiplet synchronization signals.""

This sounds a lot like the infinity cache introduced in RDNA2. RDNA2 also happens to effectively be a doubling of RDNA, with an added last level cache. I decided to go look up some block diagrams of the 2 RDNA µarchs and compare. Sure enough, when comparing between both [RDNA]( and [RDNA2]( (Images courtesy Anandtech reviews of RDNA [here]( and RDNA2 [here]( RDNA2 looks like 2 RDNA chips mirrored end to end with a last level ""infinity cache"" connecting them. A more low level [block diagram]( courtesy [Techpowerup]( seems to confirm this. 

Its quite possible that RDNA2 was basically just a tweaked RDNA in order to test out the concept of a last level cache to synchronize multiple GPUs. This would likely explain the negligible difference between RDNA and RDNA2 when compared core to core and clock to clock as in [Techspot's clock for clock comparison test]( If this is true, with AMD's unveiling of the [3d stacked 5900x]( that is an actual functional processor that is supposedly going to enter production [by the end of this year]( would mean that they are likely well under way to having a MCM Active bridge GPU on the way. If RDNA2 is any indication, AMD are remarkably close to [having linear gains]( by doubling up cores. 

If anyone happens to have both a 6900xt and a 5700xt, I would be very interested in seeing how the performance stacks up when benchmarked clock for clock.",think big navi proof concept amd mcm active chipleti reading amd patent filing active bridge chiplet integrated cache one snippit stuck active bridge chiplet communicably couple gpu chiplets e gpu chiplets n although three gpu chiplets shown fig number gpu chiplets chiplet array matter design choice varies embodiment described detail various embodiment discussed detail respect fig active bridge chiplet includes active silicon bridge serf high bandwidth die die interconnect gpu chiplet dy additionally active bridge chiplet operates memory crossbar shared unified last level cache llc provide inter chiplet communication route cross chiplet synchronization signal sound lot like infinity cache introduced rdna rdna also happens effectively doubling rdna added last level cache decided go look block diagram rdna arch compare sure enough comparing rdna rdna image courtesy anandtech review rdna rdna rdna look like rdna chip mirrored end end last level infinity cache connecting low level block diagram courtesy techpowerup seems confirm quite possible rdna basically tweaked rdna order test concept last level cache synchronize multiple gpus likely explain negligible difference rdna rdna compared core core clock clock techspot clock clock comparison test true amd unveiling stacked x actual functional processor supposedly going enter production end year mean likely well way mcm active bridge gpu way rdna indication amd remarkably close linear gain doubling core anyone happens xt xt interested seeing performance stack benchmarked clock clock

[The red stuff is L3 cahce](

With the recent demo, they essentially slapped a second layer of that L3 cache on top of it, doubling the total capacity.

Looking at Big Navi, the L3 cache surrounds the cores:



The current layout may be unsuitable for stacking, but the cache does take a big potion of that chip as well...

I suspect that AMD will try to get rid of that L3 on-die cache entirely and only rely on stacked V-Cache to provide the L3 cache entirely in the future. That way, the die can shrink even more, which is especially useful at low yields when adopting new nodes early or big die designs like big navi.

There might even be an additional latency improvement for L3 access, due to it being physically being closer to the cores, being stacked right on top of it.

Overall, the only downside with this approach i see is lowered heat dissipation/conduction to the heatspreader due to the additional cache layer inbetween...",goal v cacheon zen core chiplet l cache red stuff l cahce recent demo essentially slapped second layer l cache top doubling total capacity looking big navi l cache surround core current layout may unsuitable stacking cache take big potion chip well suspect amd try get rid l die cache entirely rely stacked v cache provide l cache entirely future way die shrink even especially useful low yield adopting node early big die design like big navi might even additional latency improvement l access due physically closer core stacked right top overall downside approach see lowered heat dissipation conduction heatspreader due additional cache layer inbetween

1,76,0,0,0,"New AMD Patent Application Sheds Light on their Chiplet-GPU Implementation[Here is a link to the patent app](

When the first MGPU patent application was released, there were a few questions over how the chiplets would interact with each other, as well as with the CPU. There was also the question of whether or not there would be extra latency involved in this setup, and other questions such as how VRAM is handled. 

But first of all I want to make something abundantly clear, that goes against what RGT and a few other leakers are saying: **Nowhere in this patent application, or in any other chiplet GPU patent application written by AMD, is there an IO Die required for chiplet GPUs**. A lot of people may say 'well patents aren't always what comes to market', but AMD is clearly taking a different approach, and all of the patent applications to date imply that the approach is to *not use an IOD* at all. 

Now for some tasty (and long) bullet points:

* Fig. 6 shows three dies in the configuration. And to me, it seems that three-chiplet configuration is very likely. Not only because of this patent application, but also because of the fact that 3 dies is the maximum that TSMC can do with their [CoWoS-L]( (TSMC version of EMIB) tech at the moment. In fact, 3-die CoWoS-L is entering mass production in Q2 2021, which is almost right on schedule, if not a bit early, to put it into use for Navi 31. It should be noted that up to 8x HBM2E can also be connected with the 3x logic dies via CoWoS-L, but I don't think it's likely that this will happen for gaming. Especially with the infinity cache, I doubt HBM2E will be used at all. I should also add that all patent applications point to using an active silicon bridge (EMIB / CoWoS-L) in their designs and not a full silicon interposer. (See paragraph [0021], *""An active bridge chiplet couples the GPU chiplets to each other...includes an active silicon bridge that serves as a high-bandwidth die-to-die interconnect between GPU chiplet dies*). It is worth saying, though, that these patent applications don't specifically rule out more (or less) than 3 dies per package.

* As was made clear in the first chiplet GPU patent app, the CPU only talks directly to **one** of the GPU chiplets, and the entire chiplet-GPU appears as one singular GPU to the system. The first chiplet dispatches the work across the other chiplets via active bridge chiplet that includes L3 and also synchronizes the chiplets. (See paragraph [0022], ""..the CPU is coupled to a single GPU chiplet through the bus, and the GPU chiplet is referred to as a 'primary' chiplet. "")

* VRAM access: Each chiplet has it's own set of memory channels, as indicated in paragraph [0022] ""Subsequently, any inter-chiplet communications are routed through the active bridge chiplet as appropriate to access memory channels on other GPU chiplets"". The question here is if the chiplet GPUs have their own memory channels, are those memory channels exclusive to that chiplet or are they shared somehow? This is semi-resolved in paragraph [0026]: *""The memory-attached last level L3 cache that sits between the memory controller and the GPU chiplets avoids these issues by providing a consistent 'view' of the cache and memory to all attached cores""*. So where, physically, are the memory channels? A: They are on each chiplet. All memory access is controlled by the first chiplet, but memory channels are attached to L3. It should be noted that memory bandwidth scales directly with the # of chiplets on package. So for example, if a 1-chiplet GPU was built to have a 128-bit memory bus, a 2-chiplet GPU would have 256-bit...no more and no less.

* Checkerboarding: In the end of paragraph [0023], states ""...Mutually exclusive sets of adjacent pixels are processed by the different chiplets, which is referred to herein as 'checkerboarding' the pixels that are processed by the different GPU chiplets"". This harkens back to the days of SFR (split frame rendering) vs. AFR (alternate frame rendering) when rendering over crossfire / SLI. However it seems like these 'sets' of pixels will be much smaller, and not based on a simple line drawn across the screen. This should prevent screen tearing and other post-processing problems associated with SFR. According to [0049] *""Each pixel (/checkerboard) ... represents a work item that is processed in a graphics pipeline. Sets of pixels are grouped into tiles having dimensions of N pixels x M pixels. Mutually exclusive sets of the tiles are assigned to different process units""*, and, further on, in [0050] *""After the pixel work items are generated by rasterization, the processing units determine which subset two [sic] process based on a comparison of the unit identifier and the screen space location of the pixel.""*, it seems to indicate that the delineation of work between the chiplets happens at the primitives level, and not at the screen-space level. This could potentially eliminate the problems that occur with post-processing effects while rendering in SFR mode, and would allow each chiplet to effectively work on different parts of the same frame.

* Chiplet Synchronization: From [0024], *""...Command processors in the GPU chiplets detect synchronization points in the command stream and stop (or interrupt) processing of commands in the command buffer until all the GPU chiplets have completing [sic] processing commands prior to the synchronization point"".* Again, if a single chiplet is saturated, all of the chiplets have to wait for it to catch up. However, with checkerboarding, it's doubtful whether the workload will vary so greatly between chiplets that this will become and issue. 

* Active Bridge Chiplet: From [0026], *""...the active bridge chiplet includes a unified cache that is on a separate die than the GPU chiplets, and provides an external unified memory interface that communicable links two or more GPU chiplets together"".* The two points here being that 1) the entire L3 cache sits on the active silicon bridge itself, and nowhere on the GPU chiplets, and, 2) that the memory channels are on each chiplet (as stated above), but are controlled by only the first chiplet.

* Memory Controller: From Fig. 6, it's pretty clear that a memory controller exists on the first chiplet. However, this same memory controller would still 'physically' exist on the other 'slave' chiplets, but would be disabled and not used. Anyone familiar with chip fabrication knows that making 2 different designs instead of one involves two costs: 1) the cost of making separate designs in the first place, making a 2nd set of masks, etc, and 2) the cost associated with the loss of scalability of the design. So although the patent application doesn't explicitly mention that there won't be a separately-designed 'IO die', it is quite clear that each of the chiplets in this multi-chiplet GPU are identical, and that there will be some dark silicon on each die.",amd patent application shed light chiplet gpu implementation link patent app first mgpu patent application released question chiplets interact well cpu also question whether extra latency involved setup question vram handled first want make something abundantly clear go rgt leaker saying nowhere patent application chiplet gpu patent application written amd io die required chiplet gpus lot people may say well patent always come market amd clearly taking different approach patent application date imply approach use iod tasty long bullet point fig show three dy configuration seems three chiplet configuration likely patent application also fact dy maximum tsmc cowos l tsmc version emib tech moment fact die cowos l entering mass production q almost right schedule bit early put use navi noted x hbm e also connected x logic dy via cowos l think likely happen gaming especially infinity cache doubt hbm e used also add patent application point using active silicon bridge emib cowos l design full silicon interposer see paragraph active bridge chiplet couple gpu chiplets includes active silicon bridge serf high bandwidth die die interconnect gpu chiplet dy worth saying though patent application specifically rule le dy per package made clear first chiplet gpu patent app cpu talk directly one gpu chiplets entire chiplet gpu appears one singular gpu system first chiplet dispatch work across chiplets via active bridge chiplet includes l also synchronizes chiplets see paragraph cpu coupled single gpu chiplet bus gpu chiplet referred primary chiplet vram access chiplet set memory channel indicated paragraph subsequently inter chiplet communication routed active bridge chiplet appropriate access memory channel gpu chiplets question chiplet gpus memory channel memory channel exclusive chiplet shared somehow semi resolved paragraph memory attached last level l cache sits memory controller gpu chiplets avoids issue providing consistent view cache memory attached core physically memory channel chiplet memory access controlled first chiplet memory channel attached l noted memory bandwidth scale directly chiplets package example chiplet gpu built bit memory bus chiplet gpu bit le checkerboarding end paragraph state mutually exclusive set adjacent pixel processed different chiplets referred herein checkerboarding pixel processed different gpu chiplets harkens back day sfr split frame rendering v afr alternate frame rendering rendering crossfire sli however seems like set pixel much smaller based simple line drawn across screen prevent screen tearing post processing problem associated sfr according pixel checkerboard represents work item processed graphic pipeline set pixel grouped tile dimension n pixel x pixel mutually exclusive set tile assigned different process unit pixel work item generated rasterization processing unit determine subset two sic process based comparison unit identifier screen space location pixel seems indicate delineation work chiplets happens primitive level screen space level could potentially eliminate problem occur post processing effect rendering sfr mode allow chiplet effectively work different part frame chiplet synchronization command processor gpu chiplets detect synchronization point command stream stop interrupt processing command command buffer gpu chiplets completing sic processing command prior synchronization point single chiplet saturated chiplets wait catch however checkerboarding doubtful whether workload vary greatly chiplets become issue active bridge chiplet active bridge chiplet includes unified cache separate die gpu chiplets provides external unified memory interface communicable link two gpu chiplets together two point entire l cache sits active silicon bridge nowhere gpu chiplets memory channel chiplet stated controlled first chiplet memory controller fig pretty clear memory controller exists first chiplet however memory controller still physically exist slave chiplets disabled used anyone familiar chip fabrication know making different design instead one involves two cost cost making separate design first place making nd set mask etc cost associated loss scalability design although patent application explicitly mention separately designed io die quite clear chiplets multi chiplet gpu identical dark silicon die

1,38,0,3,0,"Changes made to Rule #6Hello /r/AMD, in recent weeks the moderators have been in discussion about re-wording Rule 6 to better reflect our vision for the sub and how the rule is enforced.

We all favour open discussion and want /r/AMD to be a place with as minimal rules or restrictions about what can be posted, while still maintaining interesting user discussion regarding speculation and rumors.

Rule 6 used to read

---

&gt; ""No unsubstantiated rumors - rumors or other claims/information not directly from reputable sources must have evidence to support them. Any rumor or claim that is just a statement from an unknown source containing no supporting evidence will be removed.""

---

Rule 6 will now read

---

&gt; ""Do not post or crosspost unsubstantiated rumors, leaks or claims as news from random Twitter, Reddit or other forum accounts.""

---

And before anyone asks, Rule 6 will not cover Twitter accounts like kopite7kimi, OMACHI_ENSAKA, momomo_us and similar, these accounts and other similar accounts not mentioned are well known leakers with good track records and are often cited by the likes of VideoCardz, TechPowerUP, OC3D and more.

Rule 6 is targeted at post like 'my dad works at AMD and has insider knowledge and he said the 7900 XT' etc...

Anything not confirmed by AMD should be treated as a rumor with varying amounts of salt taken depending on the claim and source.

Along with this change, the ban on WCCFTech and has been lifted. In discussion with the other moderators we've agreed they are no better or worse than many other websites and publications that are allowed on here, the ban was also circumvented whenever a video from WCCFTech's YouTube channel was posted and there were exceptions to the original ban, such as the article being an exclusive, review or translation.

These changes won't be popular with everyone, but these rules better reflect our vision for the sub and changes to our community, for which /r/AMD has more than doubled in size over the last year.

We encourage everyone to treat rumors as rumors and to take a grain of salt with anything not officially confirmed by AMD.

Any other alternatives I should be aware of? I'm not sure if there is something in Radeon settings maybe? My video profile has always been on default, for what it's worth.

I recall having an old Samsung Note 3 long ago that did something like this with an enhanced video setting. A simple toggle off and it went away. I can't seem to find anything else like that except for disabling hardware acceleration in Chrome's settings.

For what it's worth, this doesn't happen on browsers like Firefox, but I will admit I do like Chrome a bit more and I prefer to use it if I can. I suppose if this can't be sorted I'll move to Firefox for the time being, but I, of course, would prefer not to.",way deal weird color auto adjustment chromium browser seem always playing video sure suited r amdhelp remove post getting issue play video netflix youtube etc chromium browser chrome edge etc color auto adjust every time put tab video focus x xt couple month recall always issue googling messed hardware acceleration turn remedy issue color adjust however dunno worthwhile hardware acceleration seem minor benefit tried messing force color profile chrome setting none option sort matter ddu installed different radeon software version preferred one currently happens seems tried optional one currently get forget number alternative aware sure something radeon setting maybe video profile always default worth recall old samsung note long ago something like enhanced video setting simple toggle went away seem find anything else like except disabling hardware acceleration chrome setting worth happen browser like firefox admit like chrome bit prefer use suppose sorted move firefox time course prefer

* 35W TDP for low fan noise under full load (I'm aware AMD calculates TDP differently from Intel). I don't want to run an AIO/CLC.
* good single core performance for gaming
* good multi core performance for compilation, I currently have workloads that load all cores for 30 minutes

I don't care about the iGPU.

However what concerns me is that the 5750GE only seems to offer PCIe 3.0, not PCIe 4.0?

Is this true? Is this true also if I disable the iGPU?

1,18,0,1,0,"Can future uses of X3D involve stacking on the I/O die? Would an I/O die with cache be an option, or would that cost too much?So, I've been reading a lot of articles on Semi Engineering, IEEE and Semi Wiki about 3D stacking for a while, and [Dr. Cutress's article about the V-Cache announcement]( mentioned the possibility of putting the SRAM *underneath* logic instead, which would be better for cooling, but make it harder to deliver power to the logic.

But logic doesn't just need power, it also needs I/O. IIRC, the biggest idle power draw on Zen2 and Zen3 chiplets is the connection between the CCD and the I/O die, and that's the biggest source of latency as well, mainly on Zen2, but Zen3 still experiences it with chiplet-to-chiplet communication, even if it has to go chiplet-to-chiplet less often than Zen2 did.

If only there was a way to make communication between the I/O die and the CCDs faster and more efficient, maybe by travelling over a shorter distance...

Current X3D stacking and V-Cache rely on cache-on-cache stacking, because cache doesn't get as hot as logic does. I don't know how hot the PHY for I/O gets, but given that the x570 chipset needs a fan, and it's the same die design as the Zen2 and Zen3 I/O die, I imagine it gets a little bit hot.

In RDNA2, the ""Infinity Cache"" is a Last Level Cache that's physically closer to the GDDR6 memory controllers, so there seem to be some advantages to having cache and I/O closer together, for latency and power efficiency reasons.

The idea I had after reading the article: Make an I/O die with all the memory controllers, PCIe, USB and everything else, and put a big chunk of SRAM in the middle of it. Then, stack a CCD with CPU cores or GPU Compute Units, or both on top of the SRAM, and connect it to the I/O die with TSVs.

The main problem I see with this idea is that it would be a sort of reversal of the current paradigm, where AMD's I/O dies are the cheap dies made on older nodes.

Because I/O doesn't shrink very well, and SRAM cache doesn't either. The biggest improvement to I/O density in a while now has been TSMC's 5nm node, where I/O got a 1.2x density improvement. For their 3nm node, logic gets a 1.7x density improvement, SRAM gets 1.2x, and I/O gets 1.1x.

Putting SRAM and I/O, the two things that aren't shrinking super well, on the same die, might not be ideal from a cost perspective. Even if you can save by not including as much SRAM on the CCDs, and include more logic instead. And that's not even getting into the packaging costs that 3D stacking will add over traditional 2D packaging and substrates.

I will say, though, that, from my understanding, (which might be totally wrong) my description of a sort of ""I/O + SRAM cache chiplet"" kinda sorta already exists? Because I'm pretty sure that's a lot like how FPGAs work. I'm pretty sure most FPGAs consist mainly of SRAM cells, lookup tables, and I/O.

If I'm understanding [this die shot]( and [this block diagram]( correctly, an FPGA is a lot like how I pictured an SRAM+I/O die looking. Big SRAM in the center, I/O on the outside. Granted that the programmable data fabric and look-up tables in an FPGA are loads more complicated than ""just"" regular SRAM like everything else uses.

I'm sure AMD couldn't just take one of the existing Xilinx FPGAs and just start stacking Zen CCDs on top of it, there would probably have to be some re-engineering and design work involved. And they'd probably have to design the SRAM so that the TSVs can go through it properly, and they'd need to make sure the socket and software could communicate with the package properly and all of that. I assume that's probably why they didn't do it for the recent Zen3 + V-Cache announcement, because the AM4 socket and the Vermeer package were already laid out a certain way.

But does anyone see a problem with my assumption that I/O + cache would be ideal for the bottom level of a 3D-stacking solution?

1,18,0,1,0,"Super low CPU (Ryzen, 2700x) score in timespy (Scores at the bottom) 

So, ive been having really bad fps issues with this PC since ive had it, which is about 2 years ago now.

So I decided to run Timespy just to see and damn, the score from my Ryzen 2700x sucks. Compared to most other people using one my score is like, 3000+ points lower. My frames must be a CPU issue, ive changed my GPU with another of the same, didnt fix it, also the ram has been changed.

Ill post my specs below, along with my average frames with games and also a pic of my entire timespy results.

My Specs are as follows.

* RTX 2080TI (No overclock - Have tried and doesnt do anything)
* Ryzen 2700x (no overclock - Have tried and doesnt do anything)
* 16GB DDR4 @ 3200mhz
* Games installed on a NVME SSD
* Playing in 1080p @ 144hz

Average frames are as follows.

Biggest example: - I have been playing Days Gone, with my spec people have been getting frames with an average of 140fps, @ 1080p max settings. With Dips to no less than 100. Im getting an average of 70fps with dips into the low 50's all the time, lowest ive seen is 49fps thus far. Its not like its a stutter to that frame, its @ 49fps until I move away from that area, then when I come back the frames tank again, even then, the highest ive ever seen it go it 90, and thats in the middle of nowhere with nothing on screen. Even with everything happening benchmarks show specs like mine never dropping to 49, hell not even dropping below 100. This should NOT be happening with a PC like this.

* Call of Duty: Warzone - Average of 60fps with frequent dips to 52 fps @ 1080p (changing settings from highest to lowest settings does literally nothing).
* Call of Duty: Black Ops, Cold War - Average of 60fps with frequent dips to 55 fps @ 1080p (changing settings from highest to lowest settings does very little)
* Cyberpunk 2077 - Average of 40fps without raytracing, average of 30 with raytracing @ 1080p (Changing from highest to lowest settings only gives me about 10 more fps).
* Horizon: Zero Dawn - Average of 55fps @ 1080p, changing from highest to lowest settings nets me about 20fps giving me an average of 75fps but still dips below 60 in some areas).
* DayZ: Standalone - Average of 50fps @ 1080p, changing settings doesnt do anything.
* World of Warcraft - Average of 52fps @ 1080p (Changing from highest settings to the lowest settigns nets a huge performance gain, this is the only game that has this effect. Ill sit at about 100fps with everything as low as it can go)
* Valorant - Average of 120fps @ 1080p (Changing from highest to lowest settings changed the average to about 140fps, also @ 1080p)
* Escape from Tarkov - Average of 50fps @ 1080p with drops to 45fps fairly often (Changing settings does practically nothing)

Ive done everything you can think of to fix my frames.

So, does anyone here have any clue to whats going on, temps are always fine on both the GPU and CPU, so are the clock speeds. So no throttling, ive reinstalled windows countless times, even fresh install with nothing on my pc but drivers and one game to test, ive reset the cmos, clean drivers.

Im at a complete loss.

I am currently sitting at around high 40's to low 50's at idle and high 70's to low 80's when gaming. Ambient temp in the room varies due to my office being on the lower level so at night it can get as low as 15 and as high as the mid 20's during the day. So I am curios what the answers here will be because after calling Canada Computers and asking, they said that this was fine and I quote ""Oh wow! that's actually quite chilly! That's the stock cooler?! That's great temps!"" In there defense, I guess if it was high, they would of tried to sell me an aftermarket CPU cooler. After reading up, I've seen that the 3600 runs on the hotter side but have seen equal arguments for it being perfectly fine to it being equivalent to having a nuclear reactor sitting next to me. So ya, really any clarity would be great!!",safe temp idle gaming build deepcool matrexx w mm built fan deepcool gold w stock cooler gigabyte vision oc corsair vengeance rgb pro gb wd blue tb currently sitting around high low idle high low gaming ambient temp room varies due office lower level night get low high mid day curio answer calling canada computer asking said fine quote oh wow actually quite chilly stock cooler great temp defense guess high tried sell aftermarket cpu cooler reading seen run hotter side seen equal argument perfectly fine equivalent nuclear reactor sitting next ya really clarity great

I'm a noob and just started playing with OC'ing my 5900x which is being cooled with a 240mm AIO.

My Bios on my Asus x570-i is set that PBO is set to Auto and my Curve Optimizer at -15 on all cores. I tried downloading Ryzen Master and creating a profile with Precision Boost Overdrive. The performance was gnarly with all cores hitting about 4.4-4.5ghz when running Cinebench R23. The only worry was the temps being 90C for 10 whole mins.

My question is, do I need to have PBO enabled in BIOS or should I turn that off if i use Ryzen Master? Second question is it safe to be running at 90C for extended periods of time on a 5900x?

I hope you and your loved ones are doing well in these unprecedented times.  
 

I am not sure how closely you have been following the cryptocurrency news recently. In case you have not joined the Pi Network yet, I am sending you an invitation.  
 

Pi is a new digital currency introduced on Pi Day (3/14) in 2019. It is a new type of blockchain technology developed at Stanford. It uses smartphones instead of computers. The ""mining"" process for each coin does not require solving puzzles, wasting energy, or using your phone data. You just mine it by tapping the app once a day to confirm you are human.  
 

As part of your invitation, I am sending you 1π!

To claim your Pi, download the Pi Network app (on an iPhone or Android device) and use my username (DrEEEEE) as your invitation code.  
 

Pi is not a scam. You can Google it, search for the core team members and view their published articles and citations on Google Scholar, view their social media to confirm network growth and updates, watch countless videos from many trusted sources explaining the technology and concept. The Pi Network channel on Youtube is hosted by the founders explaining the network and technology in the videos. You should also check out the comments and questions below those videos to see the intense enthusiasm and interest in this new project. Once you download the app, you can also view the latest information and messages from core team members, who are all Standford University Ph.D. and MBA recipients. The founder, my colleague Dr. Kokkalis, lectures a cryptocurrency course at Stanford, so their updates include the videos of these lectures as well. I have learned quite a lot from them just in the past few weeks since I joined.  
 

The network is growing quickly. It reached 14 million members last month. The core team members plan to close the network and end the mining process when the network reaches around 100 million members. At that time, you will be able to trade the Pi you have mined for actual currencies, just like Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. The members of the network will also be rewarded for any transaction fees collected and advertising revenue from their app. Also, their network is already open to programmers to develop apps specific to that network. All of the revenue generated will also be shared with the network members daily. The daily active users and the large ecosystem created by the network give Pi a certain value other cryptocurrencies do not possess.  
 

Pi was launched as a three-phase project. The first phase involved growing the network and mining a limited number of coins. The second phase of testing the network is already running. The third and final phase will be Mainnet. This is the phase where you can actually trade the Pi you have earned. The Mainnet phase is expected to be launched within months.   
 

As the network expands, the mining rate (currently 0.1 Pi per hour) is cut in half at each benchmark, such as 10 million, 100 million members, etc. This halving is intended to create the ""scarcity"" concept. Similar to Bitcoin, the total number of Pi created will be limited. I am sure you have heard the Bitcoin halving (mining rate being cut in half) last year created enormous demand, sending the price of one Bitcoin to over $61K recently! At this time, we don't know exactly how much each Pi will be worth once trading starts at the third phase of the project. Estimates range from a few cents to a few dollars per Pi. However, it is not unusual for a new cryptocurrency to experience 100 or even 1000-fold increases in value within a year. In case you are not familiar with cryptocurrency values, you can search historical prices for Bitcoin and Ether to see these exponential increases.

 Once you join the network, you will also be receiving 25% of the Pi I am mining daily as a bonus. This also applies to everyone who joins your team in the future. This incentive structure has helped them grow their network so quickly. The app also allows you to see how much your ""team"" is mining in real-time. Pretty exciting and engaging, in my opinion. You can currently mine almost 3 Pi a day with just me as your one team member to start. If you have a decent size network, that number can get much higher.  
 

Feel free to read the FAQ and white paper explaining the concept on their secure website, minepi dot com. Once you download the app you will need the invitation code DrEEEEE to create your account, since every member needs an invitation to sign up. When you accept you will see me listed as a verified member, under your Earning Team.  
 

Keep in mind that they are planning to close the network when they reach around 100 million members and the Pi mining rate will eventually be reduced to zero, limiting the total number of Pi in circulation and increasing the value of each Pi mined until then. The network growth rate so far seems to be around 20% a month and Pi already has more daily active users than any other cryptocurrency!   
 

If you have any questions about Pi, the technology, digital currencies, or finance in general, I am happy to help any time.

1,7,0,1,0,"5900X PBO Curve vs VCore intuitionI have dialed in a solid OC/undervolt on a 5900x with NH-D15 on a B550 Strix, with -0.05 VCore and 32GB 3600 CL15 B-die.  I can hit 22k on cinebench R23 when the room is cold with \~195W heat being moved around, but if I lower voltage more to reduce that, I run into motherboard EDC limits at 190A. The curve optimizer settings are lots of -30, 2nd best core at -25, best at -20.  I have to run LLC 3 or 4 to make this stable. I have a couple cores boosting past 5GHz with +150 offset and 1X scalar.

My question stems from the observation that I might have too many cores at -30. Is it an indication that some of those cores could go further than others and I just do not know which yet?  Would it make sense to start over dialing in curve offsets from a larger (eg -.1V) Vcore to push all the curve offsets up?  For example, what's -30 now might end up being a -15.  Usually curve is going to give you more of a benefit than a flat offset, but I bet I could lower my VCore a little and get better numbers overall.

I just wonder if I'm thinking about this correctly and where's a sweet spot, if any in other people's experience.",x pbo curve v vcore intuitioni dialed solid oc undervolt x nh b strix vcore gb cl b die hit k cinebench r room cold w heat moved around lower voltage reduce run motherboard edc limit curve optimizer setting lot nd best core best run llc make stable couple core boosting past ghz offset x scalar question stem observation might many core indication core could go others know yet make sense start dialing curve offset larger eg v vcore push curve offset example might end usually curve going give benefit flat offset bet could lower vcore little get better number overall wonder thinking correctly sweet spot people experience

1,17,0,1,0,"6900 XT temperature behaviorGood day,

I recently bought a Sapphire RX 6900 XT Nitro+ SE, but I am concerned about the temperatures.

It  behaves very strangely. As soon as I start a game the temperatures  immediately go up to 110 degrees celsius, as soon as I close the game  the temperature immediately drops to 60 degrees.

I have the fear sapphire has forgotten to apply thermal paste, or the contact to the heatsink is missing.

Are  the temperatures much too high, is the behavior normal, should I have  the GPU replaced or try to take the GPU apart myself and apply new  thermal paste? Do you have a guess as to what this is?

The GPU isn't even in a case at the moment, so airflow shouldn't be a problem.

What makes me wonder is that the GPU gets so hot even with only 200W power draw.

Video of the temperatures:

1,31,0,1,0,"Here's Why FSR Is Available For Competitor Cards &amp; Old AMD Cards Instead Of RX 6000+ OnlyIf you already know why, or have came to the same conclusion as me feel free to disregard this post. It may seem obvious to a lot of people but with how often I see people upset or just asking why they did it I will explain.

As you know AMD is playing catch up with NVIDIA's DLSS, its just been out longer so more games support it. The reason old AMD cards and even NVIDIA cards get the feature too is because that means more people can and will use it, the more people that can and will use it the more demand it will have and popular it will be. A lot of games support DLSS so this is a quick way to catch up to the number of titles as NVIDIA sooner, if it was only for 6000 series cards it would take longer but now with RDNA 1, Polaris, GTX, etc people using it and demanding for it to be implemented it will be quicker. If you look at steams specs these older cards are most common, its a great strategy even if it ""incentivizes you"" not to get AMD because you can just use all their tech with nvidia plus nvidia's proprietary tech as well. 

Also since it is open source and everyone will have access to it, it will potentially speed up development for improvements because as is even in ultra quality mode it looks blurry and oily, nothing like native. People said it would be between DLSS 1 and 2 but its towards the lower end of that spectrum, like DLSS 1.2, still 0.8 off but idc if its not great right now because I have hope the amount of support and improvements coming will be great",fsr available competitor card old amd card instead rx onlyif already know came conclusion feel free disregard post may seem obvious lot people often see people upset asking explain know amd playing catch nvidia dl longer game support reason old amd card even nvidia card get feature mean people use people use demand popular lot game support dl quick way catch number title nvidia sooner series card take longer rdna polaris gtx etc people using demanding implemented quicker look steam spec older card common great strategy even incentivizes get amd use tech nvidia plus nvidia proprietary tech well also since open source everyone access potentially speed development improvement even ultra quality mode look blurry oily nothing like native people said dl towards lower end spectrum like dl still idc great right hope amount support improvement coming great

1,42,0,1,0,"Is the 5800x worth the moneyHey Everyone, I'm currently running a 2700x CPU with an RTX 2060 on an Aorus Pro WiFi motherboard. I'm thinking that my next upgrade is going to be the CPU. 

My first question is how big of an improvement is it going from the Zen+ architecture to Zen3. I've watched benchmark videos, but I can't wrap my head around them sometimes. 

My second question is this. I like having the 8 Cores of the 2700x, but the price point for the new 5800x seems a little steep, especially compared the value of the 5600x or the only decently more expensive 5900x that gives you 12 freaking cores. I'm just not seeing the value in upgrading to the 5800x. I do stream games from my computer alongside doing some occasional audio and video editing, though not too much. I know the extra cores help with that kind of thing, so maybe it is worth saving the extra money for the 5800x. Or maybe I should save even MORE and go ith the 5900x. What do y'all think? Would the 5600x fit my needs?

Since Intel seems to back in game with their latest 11th Gen CPUs it‘s kind of weird that:

2. You can’t overclock the HX series CPUs

3. You can’t run XMP or modify the RAM timings in any way. (Not even talking about voltages or frequency…just tightening up timings would be better than 22-22-22 @ 3200Mhz)

4. You can’t adjust the Infinity Fabric Clock.

This makes the “AMD Package” look kind of outdated in 2021 against what Intel offers. I know Multicore and Battery Life are (probably) vastly superior on AMD CPUs, but for the high-end gamer it’s kind of sad…

I also have a desktop with an AMD 5800H and I tuned it to “perfection”…3800Mhz IF, Curve Optimizer for every single core, RAM timings for primary, secondary and even tertiary timings…so I know that it’s possible with enough time and persistence.

PLEASE AMD: Give ODMs the option to provide end users with an “unlocked” BIOS!

Thank you and don’t let your lead be taken away by Intel so easily…

PS: Yes, there are risks involved in all those tuning options - you can brick your fancy Laptop really fast, BUT I know that some ODMs already provide “reset/backup” solutions for a bricked BIOS on their machines. So give ODMs/Users the option to take the risk if they wish to do so!

Basically my only option is to upgrade my CPU to a 5800x + B550i (would really like a 5900x but can't find it at msrp). Does anyone know if the 5800x and Vega 64 can handle live streaming a game like BF5, BF6, Warzone etc in 1440p resolution?

I'm guessing it should be fine with x264 at 720p60 med or fast for now until I can find a 6800xt right?

I know people are gonna say get an RTX for NVENC but they're all way overpriced so that's my only option right now :(

On another note, I wonder if I can re-use the 2600x as a dedicated streaming PC, but the only other GPU I have is a GTX 770 from ages ago (which I'm not even sure still works). But then I'll need an Elgato capture card which I don't think I can afford at the moment.",gaming streaming build x vega adviceok current build x gb c vega p resolution trying upgrade handle gaming streaming time gpu availability look x worse believe complaining back looking today situation basically option upgrade cpu x b really like x find msrp anyone know x vega handle live streaming game like bf bf warzone etc p resolution guessing fine x p med fast find xt right know people gonna say get rtx nvenc way overpriced option right another note wonder use x dedicated streaming gpu gtx age ago even sure still work need elgato capture card think afford moment

1,55,0,1,0,"Is it me, or does V-Cache seem a lot more interesting for GPUs and APUs than the CPUs they showed?Like, it's definitely cool tech, and obviously CPUs need cache and memory bandwidth, and AMD's benchmarks showed a 25% improvement in Monster Hunter World, so obviously there's *some* benefit there.

But like, Navi 21 has a 520mm^2 die and a 128MB Infinity Cache. Less than the 192MB of a 2-chiplet V-Cache. And the bandwidth for the Infinity Cache on RDNA2 is 1,664GB/s. Less than the 2TB/s of V-Cache.

Could Navi21 be smaller if it stacked V-Cache instead of including all the Infinity Cache on-die? Would that be cheaper? Make a relatively small 80CU GPU die (with I/O, and the L0, L1 and L2 caches) and then stack the 128MB Infinity Cache die on top of it? Or maybe under it? You're paying for 2 dies, but both of the dies are smaller than if everything was monolithic.

And for a while now, APUs have been held back by memory bandwidth constraints on the integrated graphics. V-Cache seems like the perfect solution.",v cache seem lot interesting gpus apus cpu showed like definitely cool tech obviously cpu need cache memory bandwidth amd benchmark showed improvement monster hunter world obviously benefit like navi mm die mb infinity cache le mb chiplet v cache bandwidth infinity cache rdna gb le tb v cache could navi smaller stacked v cache instead including infinity cache die cheaper make relatively small cu gpu die l l l cache stack mb infinity cache die top maybe paying dy dy smaller everything monolithic apus held back memory bandwidth constraint integrated graphic v cache seems like perfect solution

1,66,0,1,0,"FSR could improve a lot when used in combination with RISI took the liberty of extracting 4 frames from the AMD video after downloading it in the best quality possible, then I used FFMPEG to apply Contrast Adaptive Sharpening to them (only to the right side, the native resolution side is left as it was).

[Imgur album with the screenshots for comparison:](

[Imgsli direct comparison using one screenshot:](

The Ultra Quality results were very surprising, CAS did a very good job at putting them much closer to the native resolution by getting rid of the blurriness. While the lose of detail is something CAS can't do anything about, it does look good enough for me to consider it as a solid alternative to native resolution.

The Quality results, however, were way less impressive. They do look better than without CAS, but the downgrade in quality from native resolution is still very clear.

Take into consideration that because I'm sharpening frames from a video downloaded from YouTube, I'm also sharpening compression artifacts. For this reason the results would be a lot better in-game when using RIS instead of applying CAS to a heavily compressed screenshot. Because of that, this test is far from perfect, but it's the best I can do with the little I have.

Imgur also compressed all the images by turning them into jpegs, so I'm including a Google Drive link with the pngs in case you want to download them from a better comparison:

1,3,0,1,0,"Question regarding the v-cache addition and the core architecture.Hi guys,

I'm not a specialist, but i've seen since zen 2 a lot of posts related to the core arch and the cores not being fed enough data to being used properly. 

My guess is that zen 3 cores are even ""stronger"" in a sense and the new cache pool help alleviate that issue but not completely, which means the new bigger cache will also feed the cores enough. 

so by making cores stronger in the long term strategy they can just add more cache to feed them enough data and get better ipc easily.. once the whole process is mastered ?

my apologies, I know I explain things poorly, I was hoping you guys could give me more insight.

1,584,0,1,0,"FidelityFX Super Resolution ""Ultra Quality"" comparisonsI tried posting these last night in a comment to the news post and I think that Reddit blocked it because I was using external links. I'd like to try again with attachments, since I think that some people may be interested.

I downloaded the FSR reveal video in 4K and saved a few keyframes of the ""Ultra Quality"" comparisons as BMPs. I then enlarged several areas 4x (without resampling) to show the differences more clearly (especially for those without 4K displays) and saved them in JPEG with 100% quality (because the BMPs were 30MB each). You may need to right click them and choose to open them in a new tab to see their full size and really spot the differences.

[Scene 1](

[Scene 2](

My personal takeaway is that, even with ""Ultra Quality"" mode on an RX 6800 XT, there's rather significant loss of detail and blurring. I'll be honest and note that I've never used DLSS, but I've seen image comparisons with DLSS 2.0 on and off and I find it a lot harder to spot differences in them than with FSR on and off here.

My aim here isn't to trash FSR. I'm glad that AMD is providing it, especially because I expect that they'll improve it over time. I just think that we shouldn't get our hopes up too high and assume that it'll rival DLSS when it debuts. Draw your own conclusions, though.

Recently, I upgraded my pc and decided to use the leftover parts to build my girlfriend a system.

I found a good deal on a Ryzen 5 2600 and ordered it. I shortly after accidentally placed it in the plastic shell backwards, which bent the pins. Using a razor and a 5mm mechanical pencil, I bent them back into shape and placed it into the system.

It worked, but the system would crash after running for some time. When it crashed, It is almost as if the reset button had been pushed- it turned off and immediately turned back on as if being turned on normally. I managed to get it to run a full benchmark, and it seems that it only crashes at idle or low usage.

I have fully troubleshot everything, and it is the CPU causing this, as replacing it with a different unit eliminated the crashing.

I was thinking that if I had caused damage to the pins, (which are clearly working) perhaps a bad contact is being made and I could use heat (an oven) to heat up the unit to possible help, as many have done with GPU's.

I was wondering what your thoughts on this are.

1,2,0,1,0,"RISC vs. CISC Is the Wrong Lens for Comparing Modern x86, ARM CPUsThe concept of ""RISC vs. CISC"" and ""x86 versus ARM"" are so tightly intertwined, if you Google ""x86 ARM"", all of the top hits from Google define ""x86 versus ARM"" in terms of ""CISC versus RISC."" These terms, however, are not a particularly useful way to think about modern microprocessors. 

This article (I'm the author) discusses the mid-1990s development of both AMD and Intel CPUs and how the initial controversy over the supposed RISC-like nature of modern x86 CPU developments got started. 

Intel is the company most commonly associated with the development of x86 micro-op decode and out-of-order execution engines, but the technique actually debuted with a NexGen CPU. AMD later bought NexGen, and the company's last CPU design became the K6. The AMD K5 (an in-house design) combined an x86 decoder with design elements lifted directly from the Am 29000, then one of the most popular RISC CPUs on the market.

The retailer has since tried to repair the card, failed, send it off to AMD, they failed, and AMD has returned to the retailer a working sample, and... That's where it stopped.


The retailer received the GPU, and is now simply not sending it back to me. They keep saying they have sent it to me and that it already arrived, whilst both me and the alleged postal company both are certain it wasn't shipped at all, and that it's a total lie. I have emailed back and forth for months with them and they just stopped responding after I called them out on their contradictory statements multiple times. They hang up on me when I call them. I even have audio recordings with our postman to confirm there was no such package.


I know GPU's are expensive and that they'd prefer not to RMA such a piece of expensive equipment when it was originally bought for less, but come on.

I've been without a PC for multiple months now as I have no iGPU, I missed any chance of studying for my exams in this now-online world, and as such had a little tear as I waved goodbye to my status as a probable honors student.

The Arctic Liquid Freezer II 360 Revision 4 cooler I ordered arrived yesterday, I tried installing it and after following the guide at [ as well as [ I noticed that my mounting bracket is **extremely** close to the capacitors near my VRMs, with about 1mm or less distance between the two.

Now the mounting thingy is made out of metal, when I noticed how close they were I aborted the installation as I was unsure if it would cause it to short or not.

I’m trying to OC my 5800X (Asus TUF x570 Plus-WiFi, 32GB 3600Mhz CL16, BeQuiet Dark Rock Pro 4), and I set the negative offset to 30 on all cores and +200Mhz (capping out at 82 degrees F). Going through other people’s guides, I was supposed to have crashes by now, but it starts up every time without a hitch. When I started I was getting (CPU-Z) 630/6430, and now with the curve set I get 645/6660. Which I realize is a decent increase in Multicore, but single core is marginally better, compared to what I see other people getting. 

According to Ryzen Master, during the multi thread test, it’s pushing all cores to 4660Mhz and varies, single core gets 4800Mhz seemingly with a hard cap.

Am I just looking at the numbers wrong and I’m actually getting a sizable performance increase, or am I getting things mixed up and not applying the OC correctly? To me it seems like my chip is doing really well with the curve set basically at full tilt with no issues, but I would think my Single core should be doing better than it is for the offsets I’m able to push.

1,21,0,1,0,"Is StoreMI corrupting your data?Hi folks,

So, earlier, I was looking to work on some photos in Lightroom. Here is how they looked:



As you can see, that's not entirely the hazy Scottish sunset I'd quite intended on working with. I went digging to find out what had happened, and what the cause could be. So, with my diagnostics, here's what I ruled in, and here's what I ruled out:

* Just that file  - the issue actually appeared to be widespread, with thousands of newer files exhibiting corruption issues
* Source images - They all appear fine, loaded directly from the card into Lightroom. This rules out the source files, and also the reader, and the software
* Memory - A looong memory test reveals no issues. The system appears to have no stability issues of any kind. 
* Other drives - Of the system's four drives, there are three NVMe and one mech HDD, with the third NVMe acting as cache drive for the mech HDD. Files on the first two mech drives exhibit no corruption that I can find.
* Connection issues - I tried replacing the SATA cable and changing the port to which it was connected, which made no difference to the apparent corruption issue.
* StoreMI. This appears to be the culprit.

My method for testing is to create 100GB of test data (which was just my c:\\program files folder packed in to a RAR file), and run **certutil -hashfile ""test.rar"" MD5** on the file to generate an MD5 hash of the file's contents. What I consistently found was that the source file, regardless of how many times it was duplicated on either of the NVMe drives, returned the same hash value. All 100GB of its data was copying from drive to drive or drive within drive accurately. Meanwhile, copying the source to the StoreMI-bonded mech HDD consistently returned different hash values, meaning that every test file copied with different corruptions. 

I unbonded the mech HDD from its StoreMI cache drive, and uninstalled StoreMI. I then ran tests again. This time, every test came back good. I ran them a further ten times. Again, with StoreMI now removed from the system, data was written to and read from the drive with zero corruption, even out of hundreds of gigabytes of data. 

&amp;#x200B;

\---------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

If there are other StoreMI users reading this, I'd strongly recommend testing your StoreMI-accelerated drive for the same corruption. The easiest way to do this is to create a large test file (feel free to do what I did, and just find a large folder and add it to a WinRar archive - save time by creating the archive with 'Store' level compression, which averts the need for WinRar to do anything with the data but pack it into a single large file), put it in to a folder on your C:\\ drive called 'Test', create a folder on your StoreMI drive with the same name, and then run the script below as a .bat file. It'll take a long time for your system to copy and then read through this data, but doing so will give you MD5 hashes for each file, which you can use to test whether or not they're copying correctly or not. Identical MD5 hashes = a perfect copy, different MD5s = data corruption.

1,31,0,1,0,"Ryzen 9 5900x &amp; NH-D15 = High Temperature. Share your results with air coolers 

Hello,

Recently upgraded PC from Intel i5 4460 to AMD Ryzen 9 5900x. I'm very satisfied with its performance. Main difference after upgrade I noticed that AMD CPU behaves differently temperature wise. While Intel I think got hot over time under heavy load, the AMD one temperatures skyrockets when heavy loaded. Also heard that you cannot just directly compare those two, because they are just so different pieces, and such AMD spikes are normal to certain degree.

Processor is just stock, how it came from box. Plus equipped with NH-D15 cooler.

* Under ""gaming"" loads CPU goes to 80-85 degrees and stays there.
* Under heavy all core loads it goes over 90-95, but also stays there, no throttling. Also very depends with which application you stress test it.
* IDLE temps are around 40-50, with bumps to 60 when opening apps and so on.

Main questions to which I want to find answers:

1. If you have AIR cooler on these top tier models 5900/5950 have you similar situation with temperatures, gets hot fast but still temperature stays flat ?
2. I'm assuming these 80-90 degrees measurements are just result of AIR cooler use, it cannot dissipate hot temperature very fast, but over time manages to keep CPU in temperature range where no thermal limits are applied ? Is this in some way true ?
3. This is normal behavior for these processors where they get hot fast, but in same time if no more load is applied they cool down also fast ?
4. What are your temperatures under heavy load with air coolers ?

\-

 So few things on my mind:

* My CPU chip is hotter than other ones on market.
* Air flow is not good enough due to low case fan speeds.
* Thermal paste got messed up while was mounting cooler.
* All of above ?",ryzen x nh high temperature share result air cooler hello recently upgraded intel amd ryzen x satisfied performance main difference upgrade noticed amd cpu behaves differently temperature wise intel think got hot time heavy load amd one temperature skyrocket heavy loaded also heard cannot directly compare two different piece amd spike normal certain degree processor stock came box plus equipped nh cooler gaming load cpu go degree stay heavy core load go also stay throttling also depends application stress test idle temp around bump opening apps main question want find answer air cooler top tier model similar situation temperature get hot fast still temperature stay flat assuming degree measurement result air cooler use cannot dissipate hot temperature fast time manages keep cpu temperature range thermal limit applied way true normal behavior processor get hot fast time load applied cool also fast temperature heavy load air cooler thing mind cpu chip hotter one market air flow good enough due low case fan speed thermal paste got messed mounting cooler

&amp;#x200B;

I have been a happy user of a Ryzen 5 2400G since 2 years and boy I love that chip.

The iGPU was a gift considering how well it performed for the price and the fact that it was essentially ""free.""

Rewind to a week back; my games started stuttering and crashing, pretty much randomly; more so confusing, only ""heavy games.""  


Confounded, I ran furmark at max settings at 1080p and the temps were below 60C. Puzzled further, I launched a ""lighter"" game {Brawlhalla} and witnessed so crashes (although I did notice minor stutters)...

So far, nothing made me doubt my iGPU had developed issues; I reinstalled the driver and started playing again.

Games crash randomly; again.  


Reinstall Windows, Install AMD drivers with factory reset checked.

Games freeze now, don't outright crash. At this point I believed my RAM was throwing errors and hence so was VRAM.

Ran memtest86 for an hour, no errors.

Finally, got OCCT after a bit of research and see for yourself-  
[

What? How? I never even overclocked the iGPU?

\--------------------------------------------------------------

**Experience:**

I built my PC last year in April. Everything seemed fine and I started playing some games when it would suddenly crash. At the time, I didn't understand much so I thought it was just a driver issue, so I kept ignoring this. The following months it barely crashed, which further reinforced my idea that drivers solved these crashes, but oh boy, the crashes didn't stop after some time. **The crashes were blackscreens followed by a reboot of the system.**

They were really an inconvenient and eventually made me want to rule out any possible defective components. **I changed every single piece of hardware I had and the same issue happened**. In the end, I checked my CPU &amp; RAM with MemTest64 and Prime95, I stressed my GPU with FurMark under supervised thermals, and even with a consumption of \~330W it wouldn't crash. Everything was **rock-solid under SUSTAINED loads**, but NOT when there was a suddent burst, which made me think my GPU wasn't stable at boost clocks, so I pretty much tested every single stable voltage for my clock presets.

I gave up and assumed my GPU was pushed to its very limits from the factory and that the only way to reduce these crashes was to underclock to the ""base"" and ""game"" clock of the 5700XT Reference Card... Hey! It kinda worked, or that's what I thought. Ocasionally it crashed and it really frustrated me.

**These crashes would get worse with VSR turned ON**, which made me realize my VRAM consumption was generally higher and the clocks might also boost higher.

These past days I was somewhat bored and I started testing with unofficial methods to tweak my GPU and I found out **MorePowerTool** and **Red BIOS Editor**, so I was like ""fine, I will stretch the performance to the very limits to rule out whether the clock or the memory is the culprit"".  I managed a very stable 2240 clock speed at 1200 mV, and the advertised maximum boost clock of 2150 at 1100mV, so I noticed something was really off... **I couldn't tweak my memory at all**. I assumed the VRAM modules were ""**good enough**"" and worked as intended at their 1750 MHz speed.

Today, I discovered [This Specific Post]( about VRAM configurations in a mining blog since I could not find any other guide elsewhere. Throughout the guide, there was a comment stating:

&gt; Some cards have **one memory type**, some cards have **two memory types**. Click on the dropdown menu against Memory Type and see if it has one or two types. If it has one, then you are all set, if it has two, select the other one and repeat the above three steps (copy value of 1550Mhz to all the boxes below it). 

I was very puzzled, I checked this section back then and GPU-Z reported my GPU is using Micron memory modules. I assumed I only had to change the memory configuration of the Micron section in Red BIOS Editor. **It turns out my GPU is using both Samsung and Micron memory modules** for some reason and I had to tweak the timings of each memory type in Red BIOS. To my surprise, now **the VRAM had a predictable behaviour** and I could push my memory up to a stable \~1875 MHz with expected artifacting and/or crashes if pushed too much. Also, **the PC crashes due to VRAM were identical to my concurrent random crashes I was having (**blackscreen into reboot).

**My conclusion** is that **many cards come with mixed memory modules** that result in the same **conflict** was someone could have when running RAM modules from different manufacturers due to the quality of their chips and timings. With all this, **I think managed to adjust the VRAM timings to intercompatible values** and the card is now having predictable behaviours and no crashes.",fixed xt random crash using red bios editor really upset disclaimer experience guide powercolor reddevil xt solved crash detail method likely void warranty encourage performing since requires flash gpu custom bios however experienced user want replicate risk reporting result going helpful apologize grammar mistake might make native english speaker spec cpu ryzen x gpu powercolor reddevil xt gb oc motherboard gigabyte b aorus pro ram x gb cl hyperx overall cooling pretty good supervised experience built last year april everything seemed fine started playing game suddenly crash time understand much thought driver issue kept ignoring following month barely crashed reinforced idea driver solved crash oh boy crash stop time crash blackscreens followed reboot system really inconvenient eventually made want rule possible defective component changed every single piece hardware issue happened end checked cpu ram memtest prime stressed gpu furmark supervised thermal even consumption w crash everything rock solid sustained load suddent burst made think gpu stable boost clock pretty much tested every single stable voltage clock presets gave assumed gpu pushed limit factory way reduce crash underclock base game clock xt reference card hey kinda worked thought ocasionally crashed really frustrated crash get worse vsr turned made realize vram consumption generally higher clock might also boost higher past day somewhat bored started testing unofficial method tweak gpu found morepowertool red bios editor like fine stretch performance limit rule whether clock memory culprit managed stable clock speed mv advertised maximum boost clock mv noticed something really tweak memory assumed vram module good enough worked intended mhz speed today discovered specific post vram configuration mining blog since could find guide elsewhere throughout guide comment stating card one memory type card two memory type click dropdown menu memory type see one two type one set two select one repeat three step copy value mhz box puzzled checked section back gpu z reported gpu using micron memory module assumed change memory configuration micron section red bios editor turn gpu using samsung micron memory module reason tweak timing memory type red bios surprise vram predictable behaviour could push memory stable mhz expected artifacting crash pushed much also crash due vram identical concurrent random crash blackscreen reboot conclusion many card come mixed memory module result conflict someone could running ram module different manufacturer due quality chip timing think managed adjust vram timing intercompatible value card predictable behaviour crash

I need help choosing a videocard. 

These are the prices I have locally for these cards and I have no idea which is a better buy with these prices.

Judging from RRP it looks like 6700XT is inflated at 2.8x rate

6800 is inflated at 3.2 rate.

6900xt is inflated at 2.15 rate.

I came to conclusion that judging by these prices only for gaming 6900xt is the best purchase out of all three.

Do you think it worth getting now? Do you think any possibility of price getting lower any time soon?

I just happened to look at prices for R9 390s on eBay, and I was surprised to see how high they were. 

I have an R9 390 that I sold a few years ago during the initial mining craze, and the buyer used it for exactly 30 days, at which point he filed a claim with eBay saying it no longer worked. 

Not surprisingly, when I received the card back it worked perfectly, and I ended up using it for another year before upgrading to a 2070 Super. 

So right now, I have an R9 390 collecting dust on the shelf in my office. I would might consider listing it again if these are being purchased by gamers, but if it is due to the etherium mining craze then I'd just as soon keep it, as it's not worth the frustration of having someone ""rent"" it in 30 day increments by exploiting eBay's return policy.",driving older gpu price mining lack supply gaming hi happened look price r ebay surprised see high r sold year ago initial mining craze buyer used exactly day point filed claim ebay saying longer worked surprisingly received card back worked perfectly ended using another year upgrading super right r collecting dust shelf office might consider listing purchased gamers due etherium mining craze soon keep worth frustration someone rent day increment exploiting ebay return policy

I searched 3200g and B550 and there's some posts in this subreddit about a 3200g working on some motherboards.  10 months ago.  So, I was hoping to read some updates here. 

Those posters didn't update their info.  Does it still work?  Or do Bios updates stop that combo from posting or does something else happen?

I know I could go with a B450 motherboard (probably will have to do that) but I wanted the B550.  It's newer and I hope to upgrade to zen 3/4 later.  3600/3700x/5600x etc., later.

The apu saves me from needing a discrete gpu right away.  In my country (Canada), new gt 1030:  $150; gtx 1050 ti:  $250;  gtx 1060:  $300 (CAD).  Used rx 550 $130, Rx 570/580 - over $250, I think.

So, I just wanted a system that runs that isn't too old and I'd upgrade the cpu later and get a gpu later as well.

Is a B550/3200g not going to work (now/anymore) or too risky since it won't be officially supported?

I would plan a cpu upgrade within this year.

1,1,0,1,0,"New AMD system underwhelming/unstable performanceHey everyone,

I'm hoping that some people here with more experience with AMD systems can help me out and give me some things to look at to improve performance and stability. 

My components:

* CPU: 5800X (running stock speeds)
* CPU cooler: Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo Black
* PSU: Cooler Master V850 SFX (two separate 8-pin cables running from the PSU to GPU)
* RAM: 2x 8 GB - 3200 Mhz, CL16 (XMP enabled)
* GPU: 6900 XT (running stock speeds) (drivers: 21.4.1)
* Motherboard: Gigabyte Aorus X570 I Pro Wifi (Mini ITX) (bios: F33h - newest) (latest chipset drivers installed)
* Monitor: AOC 1080p screen, 144 hz (freesync compatible) 

I've had every single component except for the 6900 XT since December. I've been running an MSI GTX 970 until a couple of weeks ago when I got my 6900 XT from the AMD website. When my system was using the GTX 970, the frames weren't all that good in Warzone and GTA 5 (as expected from a 7 year old card), but at least my system was stable during gaming, no hitching, stuttering and even random reboots. I had the feeling that the GTX 970 was being used properly and being used to its absolute limit. 

Unfortunately since I've put the 6900 XT in my system, I have a feeling that this video card isn't being used properly by games. In Warzone, after a couple of minutes, the game starts to stutter, making it virtually unplayable and it even randomly rebooted yesterday. In GTA 5, although there is no stuttering, the frames drop from 140 to as low as 90 and back again to 140 every couple of seconds. I don't know if this is normal? Maybe it was unrealistic expectations, but I honestly thought that it could keep a stable 140 almost all the time in GTA 5 in 1080p. Using the Radeon software, I noticed that the GPU utilization tends to go from 90% all the way down to as low as 30% in these games within a couple of seconds. Is this normal behavior? Also, the temperature of the 6900 XT is around 50 - 55 degrees Celsius, which seems to be really low I think. The GTX 970 I had was always running around 70+ with the exact same setup. 

When I put the 6900 XT in my system, I immediately wiped all partitions and did a complete reinstall of Windows 10 Pro, 21H1. I've done dozens of these nuke and pave installs in the past. After the installation was done, I let the system run for an hour doing its thing in the background. Afterwards, I installed the chipset drivers and video card drivers. Enabled XMP in the bios. I haven't turned on SAM or done anything else in the bios. I turned off the driver downloads that Windows does in the advanced system settings. The only thing I have on this PC right now is literally Steam, [Battle.net]( GTA 5 and Warzone.

Are there any settings I can try turning off or on? The random reboot, could it be related to the unstable USB performance with AMD CPUs? I have a bunch of USB devices and a hub hooked up to my PC. 

I also want to say that I do not have problems outside of games.

3. confirmation 3600MHz is the sweet spot now for AMD Ryzen? for FLCK at 1800 so its 1:1 ratio. Is there any reason to overclock it a bit more?
4. Or should i perhaps get a 3200MHz CL16 G.skill and overclock it to 3600MHz? (honestly i prefer just getting the 3600MHz one)

And they seem to back on 21.5.2 but it seems to be worse. In the original post I said timeout issues happen randomly.

This time, it did not happen through games but unexpectedly while watching Netflix. The driver timed out out of nowhere and screen started flickering. Then it went black but stayed that way and I could not do anything, so I forced turned off PC from power button. When it booted, I noticed everything was choppy and laggy and assumed it was normal. I played videos and they seemed to be completely stuttering. So I launched a game and noticed it was running at maximum 30 fps in the menu. I checked my monitor and it was showing as 30 hz which was weird. I opened Windows Display Driver Management and it was showing as Microsoft Basic Display Adapter with Video Ram showing as zero. Then I noticed the Adrenalin Launch icon you can find by right clicking desktop was missing, and Adrenalin was not showing in task manager. This all happendd unexpectedly and it is the first time it has happened with this driver version. The weird part is that Adrenalin just basically died after that, usually when driver timeouts it resets and works properly a few seconds later. I had to DDU and reinstall the whole driver just to get a 144 hz output again.

It is _highly_ unlikely I'll overclock, or get anything more demanding/powerful than a 5800X for a while (unless I can get one for a steal).  

I'm not obsessed with having super-low temps. I think I'd be okay with it as long as it's not obviously… ""under-capable"", but I _would_ like an air cooler with: 

* some room to grow (could perhaps handle an OC'd 5800X or stock 5900X)
* good RAM clearance
* good value; defined as a balance between price, performance, and features

Bonus: Comes in Black or White, cuz I'm _somewhat_ going for a B&amp;W build.

I'm trying to decide between (prices in CAD):

* [ARCTIC Freezer 34 Esports Duo - White](
* [Noctua NH-D15S chromax.Black]( (makes more sense than the non-S right now, given price difference and RAM clearance)
* [Scythe Mugen 5 - Black Edition]( / [Scythe Mugen 5 Rev.B]( (really not sure what Rev.B adds. They mention now offering full AM4 compatibility, but the non-Rev.B Mugen 5 mentions AM4 compatibility. Was AM4 compatibility lacking on the non-Rev.B?)

I visited the MSI site to download the BIOS but the latest version is a beta version (7C84v163). Now I'm thinking whether I should go for this one or rather go for the older one which would be from 26.01.21 (7C84v15) or maybe even older one (7C84v14).

Also if it turns out that the motherboard is indeed compatible with ryzen 5xxx would it be safer to update BIOS via M-flash (in the BIOS interface) to a newer version or just use the FLASH back button?",bios update hey guy tomorrow friend going build main part x msi tomahawk x rtx x gb cl ram box motherboard sticker tell motherboard compatible ryzen xxx even though still want prepare usb flash drive bios update case xxx ready visited msi site download bios latest version beta version c v thinking whether go one rather go older one c v maybe even older one c v also turn motherboard indeed compatible ryzen xxx safer update bios via flash bios interface newer version use flash back button

1,58,0,1,0,"Interview with Jim Keller[

There are really some great insights into the turnaround of AMD and ZEN:

&gt;The funny thing was, we knew we were kind of at the end of the road -  our customers weren’t buying our products, and the stuff on the roadmap  wasn’t any good. I didn’t have to convince people very much about that.  There were a few people who said ‘you don’t understand Jim, we have an  opportunity to make 5%’. **But we were off by 2X, and we couldn’t catch up  \[going down that route\]. So I made this chart that summarised that our  plan was to** ***‘fall a little further behind Intel every year until we  died’*****.**  
&gt;  
&gt;With Zen, we were going to catch up in one generation. There were  three groups of people - a small group believed it (that Zen would catch  Intel in one generation); a medium-sized group of people that thought  if it happens, it would be cool; then another group that definitely  believed it was impossible. A lot of those people laughed, and some of  them kind of soldiered on, despite this belief. There was a lot of  cognitive dissonance, but I found all kinds of people that were really  enthusiastic.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mike Clark was the architect of Zen, and I made this list of things  we wanted to do \[for Zen\]. I said to Mike that if we did this it would  be great, so why don’t we do it? He said that AMD could do it. My  response was to ask why aren't we doing it - he said that everybody else  says it would be impossible. I took care of that part. It wasn’t just  me, there were lots of people involved in Zen, but it was also about  getting people out of the way that were blocking it. It was fun – as  I’ve said before, computer design needs to be fun. I try to get people  jazzed up about what we’re doing. I did all kinds of crazy stuff to get  people out of that kind of desultory hopelessness that they were falling  into. 

The part about his role at Intel was also interesting:

&gt;My team at Intel was 10,000 people, right, so you spend a lot of time  on organization charts and budgets, and all kinds of admin, and then  it's easy to find yourself just doing that and saying you’ll hand off  leadership for a project to this person or this person and that. But the  problem is there's so many things that are cross-functional – I want to  know what the fab is doing, how does the PDK work, how does the library  work, how does the IP team work, how does the SoC integration work, how  does the performance model work, how does the software work. Then you  find out that if you can't deep dive into all those pieces, bad things  happen.

&amp;#x200B;

***Why is my motherboard not listed?***

It may have been recently updated. Check  to see if it has been. I post updates on a weekly basis. UEFI’s are released in waves, because of this it can take an entire series weeks or months to see the “same” update if it includes items like CPU firmware. Furthermore, keep in mind that not all updates are applicable to all models. Due to inherent design differences as well as specification and feature variation an update may only be applicable to a specific model.

***How can I be notified about UEFI updates when they are released?***

If you want to be kept in the loop, you can also follow me for notifications when updates are released/posted. I am also the admin for our PCDIY Facebook Group where I post updates and other ASUS centric product news 

***How long after a board is produced will UEFI updates be released?***

Keep in mind that generally after a year a motherboard reaches a certain maturity level and as such will see fewer updates. If you feel you have an issue that is dependent on a UEFI release, please submit a support ticket. In some cases, some boards can see updates for more than 24 months+

***I want to update but am not sure how to update the UEFI ""BIOS""?***

If you want guidance on how to flash/update your UEFI BIOS please watch the video linked below.

[

***Should I update the UEFI if my system is stable and running without issue?***

If your system is running without issue, especially if overclocked in any way ( including DRAM ) it is advised you stay on the build/release you are on. Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can change the OC experience and require you to retune a previously stable OC value. This does not mean the UEFI is not a functioning release but that changes in the underlying code base need to be accounted for when tuning a system. As many of these values are in low level or specific operating parameters it is best to retune from full UEFI defaults after you have re-run stability test at UEFI defaults.

***What if the UEFI BIOS listed is a BETA? Should I update?***

BETA UEFI releases are for enthusiasts who want access to the latest features, functions, and microcode enhancements, and overall UEFI improvements. As they are not officially supported, they are not recommended for day-to-day / long-term use. Users who plan to use their system in this capacity and want to ensure the best interoperability/compatibility and stability, as well as performance, should wait for a formal release.  
 

***How long does it take for a formal release to be issued (between BETA and formal)?***

  
The time span between a BETA and formal release can vary depending on multiple factors including new internal code being provided, validation and qualification as well as other important aspects of UEFI development and validation. Generally, you will see a formal release within 1 to 3 months. In some cases, BETAs are singular releases and will not see a formal release.

***Will a UEFI ""BIOS"" update improve the performance of my system?***

A UEFI update can include CPU microcode as well as other performance tuning enhancements that can influence/increase performance. With this noted it is generally minimal. As always performance analysis/comparisons should be done at stock-to-stock values. This means loading F5 on both releases and comparing your application/benchmark scores. OC-related comparisons may require retuning prior to testing as changes to underlying auto rules can invalidate prior scores even if with similar settings.

***Not every user should update/flash their UEFI BIOS. I stress this again, if you are running without issue(s) you are advised to stay on the release you are running.*** 

***Notes to consider -***

***\* When flashing please perform the update process at full UEFI defaults. Do NOT flash with an overclocked system/profile.***

1.I recommend updating the UEFI BIOS on your motherboard for new PC builds. This helps to ensure the best interoperability, compatibility, and performance. If you are building a PC and have not yet installed the OS, I would recommend you update the UEFI.

2.Keep in mind flashing/updating the UEFI will reset all defined parameters/settings and operating profiles. You will not be able to restore defined values by using a UEFI Profile as profiles are not interoperable between builds. It is advised you note or screenshot (F12) your values prior to flashing if they are complex. Upon completing a flash, I would recommend you load UEFI defaults after the fact and complete a full reboot and shutdown prior to re-entering your prior values. Keep in mind you may need to retune these values under a new UEFI.

3.When you update the UEFI and re-load UEFI defaults depending on your originally defined CSM/UEFI device parameters you may experience BOOT issues. Depending on prior settings you may need to enable or disable CSM to restore BOOT functionality.

4.Be advised that in some cases a rollback to a prior UEFI is not possible. This generally is the case when there is an update that includes CPU microcode (such as an AMD AEGSA or Intel ME). This means you may not be able to “flashback” to a prior release.

5.While not always necessary some UEFI updates may require a clearing of the CMOS. You can either clear the CMOS via the CLR CMOS button if your motherboard has this feature/function or you can also CLR CMOS by removing the onboard CMOS battery for at least a few minutes. You can also attempt to locate the CLR CMOS jumper on the motherboard and short the pins.

6.In some cases, you may not be able to jump from an older UEFI release to a much newer release. You may need to ""step"" update, this will mean upgrading incrementally to a slightly newer build first prior to going to the most recent build/release. In most situations this not required.

I also recommend you backup your system prior to any flash/update and always advise flash/update become executed from a fresh loading (F5) of UEFI defaults.

1,22,0,1,0,"Gigabyte 5700 XT always 85 degrees and TJ of 110+ on stock settingsHello everyone,

I bought the Gigabyte Radeon RX 5700 XT Gaming OC 8GB and while it it performs really well, there is one thing I never understood.

I searched around and found some statements that this card is supposed to run hot and junction temperatures of 110 are within spec, but is that true? 

[Here]( is an example of what happens when I play The Evil Within on full resolution (2560x1440) for instance. It's an old game so I thought maxing the settings couldn't hurt.

Regardless of the game, both temperatures always seem to max out. If I play the same game but on stock settings, I even seen the GPU hit 111 degrees which is worrying.

I'm currently using these Radeon settings:

Frequency: 1906
Voltage: 1095
Max fan speed 60%
Power limit 50%
VRAM 1748Mhz

My PC case is a [CoolerMaster H500M]( and leaves ample space for the hot air to escape.

My CPU is equiped with a [Noctua NHU12A cooler](

The room temperature ios around 23 degrees on average with my balcony door open almost the whole day as I work from home.


Sorry for the long wrtie-up but I'm really keen on finding out what is causing these high temperatures. The card is only a year old and I did everything according to the book to reduce it.

Any helps or insights is greatly appreciated.",gigabyte xt always degree tj stock settingshello everyone bought gigabyte radeon rx xt gaming oc gb performs really well one thing never understood searched around found statement card supposed run hot junction temperature within spec true example happens play evil within full resolution x instance old game thought maxing setting hurt regardless game temperature always seem max play game stock setting even seen gpu hit degree worrying currently using radeon setting frequency voltage max fan speed power limit vram mhz case coolermaster h leaf ample space hot air escape cpu equiped noctua nhu cooler room temperature io around degree average balcony door open almost whole day work home sorry long wrtie really keen finding causing high temperature card year old everything according book reduce help insight greatly appreciated

How do laptops, specifically gaming laptops, benefit from using a cooling pad ? From what i've found, cooling pads seem to provide better airflow and cooler temperatures, does this enhance performance ?

I've also read that cooling pads may damage your laptop because they blow dust into it as well as making your laptop's fans spin faster.

As for the dust, if you place your cooling pad and your laptop on a clean surface free of dust, then there shouldn't be any problem right ? My only concern is with cooling pads making laptop's fans spin faster, is it true ? If so, does it really damage the fans in the long run ?

After considering everything, are cooling pads worth it ?

I know this isn’t some extreme power build. But it is my first build since switching over from an AlienWare laptop. My computer does everything and plays everything I’ve wanted to. It was my budget build right before the pandemic. Yes I’d love to get something more powerful and modern but with prices right now I’d like to hold out for some time.

But I’d like to upgrade. So I’m asking what would be the best monitor I could get or just spec wise to get the most out of my system with a budget of about $400 tops. Most I’ve been looking at are more around the low $300 range if not less. So 1080p and higher refresh? 1440p? As I said before I’d like to upgrade later on, more likely just a whole new build. Something along the lines of 3060 and up if not a 2080 or equivalent. So would a 1440p 144Hz be too much and not play well? Asking so if that would be better to buy a higher quality monitor for more powerful setup later on. Apologies as this stuff is still somewhat new to me. I don’t hold any particular loyalty to any brand or size. Maybe something with Freesync if I’m able to? Flat or curved monitors? (I’m guessing not in the 24”-27” due to different panels). Thank you.

1,5,0,1,0,"5900x on MSI B450 Gaming Plus Max + Budget Cooler 👍 CompatibleMaking this post for anyone this may help.

I updated the bios to the most recent one, but it wasn't a simple plug-and-play installation. The PC booted up like normal, though it had noticeable stutters just browsing or opening startup programs -- it actually felt a lil worse than the 1700x I upgraded from.

[For cooling, I use a stock heatsink+fan that came with my dell inspiron 5675 prebuilt. That pc died after 2 years but I kept the cpu, ram &amp; cooler for my current custom build.]

I opened up task manager &amp; hwmonitor. The 5900x was boosting well above stock, reaching 4.6 to 4.8 in random bursts during idle. Temps spiked also, forcing my fans to run loudly at full speed. Seeing the high boost number was cool but it just felt wrong since I wasn't doing anything intensive -- cpu usage was between 4% to 16%. The sound levels were too high to run that as a daily thing.

My pc also reboot or crashed several times before I went back into the bios to change something. 

What worked for me: 

- turning off PBO completely
- changing my fan curve to max out at lower %
- changed voltage from auto (1.46) to override (1.28)
- changing cpu ratio from auto to 37 -&gt; 3.7ghz 
- ram to XMP profile 2, even though profile 1 has the same exact thing -- 3200mhz same timings

Went into cinebench r23 &amp; my 5900x performs around 18.5k multicore, which seems below average. Still hella fast in comparison to my old 1700x's score of 8.8k. But hopefully that will change when I upgrade to an AIO. Idc to overclock but don't want my cpu to underperform at stock either.

So in essence, yes the 5900x can be bios updated to be compatible with a msi b450 gaming plus max. Yes, a stock dell cooler heatsink+fan can handle the base 3.7ghz, even when gaming &amp; streaming Apex Legends for 6+ hours. Gaming FPS was a lil lower than I expected but still the best I've ever had (ranging from 130fps to 300 max). My cpu &amp; case fans still run a lil louder than I'd like but still finding the right settings til I get an AIO (hoping Gigabyte releases their new Aorus Waterforce X 240 in the US to match my new Aorus 6800xt gpu.

My cpu sits arround 65C max temps and pushing clocks at 4.5-4.6 ghz.

After so much reading about curve optimizer and undervolting, from my understanding i might be able to get the same or even better performance setting PBO with a negative offset in curve optimizer, while using less voltage on the CPU, and so, lower temps, which might increase the CPU's lifespam.

Faster single channel RAM vs Dual Channel RAM...I read that if you use XMP or overclock RAM settings and use speeds above those supported by a Ryzen CPU, it voids the warranty.

What if I don't use XMP but manually enter lower CAS latencies with a faster RAM running at the supported frequency, does that void the warranty of the CPU ?

What is the likelihood of XMP or RAM overclocking somehow damaging the CPU ?

I see that dual channel boosts the performance a lot but RAM speed and latency also make a big difference, I consider adding more RAM in the future so single stick of faster RAM will be more advantageous later but I'm not entirely sure about choosing faster single channel vs dual channel...

1,117,0,1,0,"Should I give up my 5950x and go back to Intel?Honestly, it's got to a point where I'm contemplating giving up my Ryzen 5950x and going back to Intel.

Speaking with folks over here who have the 5950x, they're all getting wonderful idle temps of 33C, and 60C while gaming. Meanwhile, I'm looking at 67-71C at idle and 86C when gaming.
Not doing anything fancy either, just running stock with a XMP Profile enabled. Super basic things. Have my BIOS at the latest version for my motherboard, MSI X570 Creation Prestige.

I figured maybe it was my coolers failing to properly cool my 5950x chip. I tried two AIO coolers thus far, the NZXT Kraken z73 and Corsair iCUE H150i Elite CAPELLIX. Tried the Kraken z73 first with its stock thermal paste, then I took it off and applied Noctua NT-H2 paste. After that, I bought the H150i and tried that (used the stock paste), and still no change in my temps.

I've basically had to rely on editing my power plan, and lowering the maximum processor state from 100% to 95% (which limits my clockspeed to 3.16 GHz), and then I see 44C at idle, which is still nowhere close to what everyone else is getting when at 100% power.

Are there some magic settings in the BIOS I'm missing to make my 5950x act 'normal'?

Coming from Intel, I never had any issues with temps and my PC never was so hot that it was turning my room into a sauna. Kind of thinking now of going back to Intel and save me from all this stress &gt;_&gt;",give x go back intel honestly got point contemplating giving ryzen x going back intel speaking folk x getting wonderful idle temp c c gaming meanwhile looking c idle c gaming anything fancy either running stock xmp profile enabled super basic thing bios latest version motherboard msi x creation prestige figured maybe cooler failing properly cool x chip tried two aio cooler thus far nzxt kraken z corsair icue h elite capellix tried kraken z first stock thermal paste took applied noctua nt h paste bought h tried used stock paste still change temp basically rely editing power plan lowering maximum processor state limit clockspeed ghz see c idle still nowhere close everyone else getting power magic setting bios missing make x act normal coming intel never issue temp never hot turning room sauna kind thinking going back intel save stress

1,14,0,1,0,"Is there a definitive RX 6000-series undervolting guide? May I ask here for advice?The only one I've come across is [this guide]( from Igor's Lab, but I don't understand it fully and thus don't know how to adapt it to my use case:

I just want to drop my 6700XT from like 230W to 180W (or so) by purely undervolting and reducing max clocks by 200 MHz (or thereabouts). The objective is to reduce heat output as much as possible, while retaining about 90% of the factory indended performance of the card. I have a small case and the chipset fan is right below the card, so it starts screaming like mad after only a couple minutes of full GPU load, so lower temps are desired.

So, with the above witten in mind...

1) Do I need to use MorePower tool to drop the voltage cieling and then try to drag down the voltage curve via offset in Wattman?

2) Do I modify max core clock in Wattman or MPT?

3) Do I need to max out the power slider to +15% in Wattman, if I'm only trying to slightly downclock and reduce voltage, and thus power cosumption in tandem?

3) Do i need to edit (lower) the GPU power limit in MorePowerTool too? (Igor's guide also suggests to modify/lower ""TCD limit GFX"" also?)

The only thing I do know how to set are the fan settings in MorePowerTool (in my experience, works better than in Wattman). I did boost the fans speed by a few hundred RPM this way and it works flawlessly.

As you see, I'm a bit confused... Any input here would be greatly appreciated!

I bit the bullet and upgraded my Ryzen 5 1400 with a new 7 5800X. Paired it up with a NH-D15S and added an extra cooler to it since I had one lying around and Noctua was kind enough to send an extra racket thingys, and I've heard rumours that the new Ryzens have a habit of running hot. The old 1400 was non-OC on a stock cooler (that turned out to have so much dust built up it might as well could have been passive) pushing 81c while hashing monero at around 2kH/s.

On non-OC the 5800x couldnt even break 70c hashing the same coin at 8kH/s, and after CTR2.1 doing its thing it barely pushes past 60c even though the hashes went up to 10kH/s, let alone wattage that doesn't go over 120W at a constant 4.6GHz. Now I know the nature of CTR is to do exactly that but I wasn't expecting the CPU to run that cool on 100% load, even with the undervolt.

The question is more of a mindset thing, should I be happy that I probably won a silicon lottery and can run this thing this fast and cool, or should I maybe try to push it further with some more unforgiving settings on the CTR? What would you do?

Long troubleshooting helped to find a possible reason: the CPU sensor that is being used to monitor temperatures isn't quite correctly show tempeartures under load. Because when I move around fan curve slider in the BIOS I can see that fans speed up. But they are not speeding up during games or synthetic benchmarks and just stay at idle.

Then I went to AIDA64 and found that AIDA's ""CPU"" sensor shows wrong reading like it will never show more than 55C on CPU while HWINFO shows 65-67C on all CPU sensor. Because of this reason my PC is getting pretty hot during games because intake fans won't spin fast enough to provide good airflow.

Issue: exceptionally high junction temp when running unlimited frames on a custom loop.

What I've found is that junction temp doesn't just measure the junctions in the GPU die. It also messures the hottest VRM! As it turns out the thermal pads on my vrms weren't contacting the waterblock by about a mm, this was causing near instant junction temps to hit 110 abd shutdown. I took it apparent abd had to scavange for some pads (from the vrm cooling of an old aaus motherboard) installed and now it's MUCH better. Before I was getting unstable runs with furmark and instant 110c, now after 6 mins I'm reaching an (idle fan) equilibrium of 68 on the GPU and 95 on the junction hotspot!

1. 3D stacking definitely on the roadmap
2. Different technologies along the price curve
3. Highest performance technology can afford different elements but cost sensitive products would be less complex
4. 2.5D and 3D packaging key element to unlock next level of performance


&gt;**Lisa Su**

&gt;Absolutely, Harlan. Look, we've been sort of a leader in this idea of sort of advanced packaging and how do you use silicon for its best performance and feature set. Really, this is the key aspect of innovation. When you think about sort of all that's said about Moore's Law slowing, it means that you're getting performance gains by going to smaller geometries, but not necessarily the same gains that you got a few years ago.

&gt;We were very early in sort of the idea of using 2.5D packaging with high bandwidth memory together with our GPUs, as well as using a chiplet architecture to really get the incredible performance that we're seeing with each generation of EPYC. You'll see us continue to innovate on that roadmap.

&gt;3D chip stacking is definitely on the roadmap. We see it as another tool in the tool chest, as you think about how do you put these different pieces together. I think what you will also see is you might see different technologies used along the price curve. You can imagine the highest performance technologies can afford different elements, and then as you get into more cost sensitive, you might not be able to use all that complexity. Think about it as AMD will push the envelope on 2.5D and 3D packaging as we go forward because it's a key element to unlock that next level of performance.

I was looking a bit deeper in the Apple M1 architecture and a question instantly popped in my head. Why does AMD use a PCIe connection to interface from CPU to GPU in there APUs?

I aknowledge the fact that the GPUs used are ""loosely"" based on desktop counterparts but it still makes no sense for me.

Let's look at the facts:  
1. The GPU already uses a chunk of the systems memory (already mapped in a way)  
2. Although there's a pcie controller/interface ready to use from standard desktop designs it's just a medium for ""converting"" instructions which could pretty easily get bypasssed, skipped or redisigned.  
3. Memory mapped io usually is faster in both bandwidth and latency, simpler and less expensive  
4. Having a separate IO chip and chiplets is more flexible and allows for such designs  
5. I believe there's already some memory map/bus/ports functionality in most CPUs, even modern ones  
6. and most importanty... it would allow to still have THE FULL 20 pcie lanes for general use AND a gpu.

I'm not an AMD engineer and as such I can't know what the reasoning is for this but I'd be surprised if memory mapping wasn't at least a consideration dusring the design phase.

1,1,0,1,0,"Graphics Card Purchases from AMD Store to the UKHello All, 

I understand that AMD supposedly no longer offers shipping to the UK from the AMD store due to Brexit, but have seen others here on reddit able to buy and have the reference model graphics cards shipped to them in the UK. As retailers are releasing more stock but at highly inflated prices (£750+ for a 6700xt), i was wondering is this might be an option i could look into, despite the bot issue the AMD store website was facing at some point (unsure if this is still an issue)

For those people, or anyone else who knows how this happened, could you explain it? 

Can these cards still be shipped direct to the uk or did these people have them sent to family / other addresses overseas?

&amp;#x200B;

I have a ryzen 5 3600 and I know it has 24 pcie lines, and I have them distributed as follows.

16 lines for the gpu (pcie 3.0x16)

4 for an nvme (pcie 3.0x4)

and 4 to the chipset (pcie 3.0x4) where I currently only have 2 hdd's

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, if I connect a second nvme to the chipset port and it works at full pcie 3.0x4, will all sata ports be disabled? or maybe the rear usb ports? or maybe both?

&amp;#x200B;

if so, in that case better get a sata ssd and so I do not interfere with the pcie lines?

Just to clarify, my motherboard is an Aorus B550M Pro, and I want the second ssd to store my games, be it a 2Tb NVME or a 2tb Sata SSD, they cost practically the same, but with the big difference in speeds of read / write (3000Mb vs 500Mb approx) (both being faster than hdd)

Which one would you choose and why?

Would the usb and sata ports be disabled with 2 nvme?

I do game on the same machine, currently on a GTX 1060 1080p 144hz. Planning to upgrade to a 3070/3080 later and a 1440p monitor.

Do the two extra cores provide any noticeable advantage for work (as described) and daily usage? If they do, I figure that later at 1440p the bottleneck won't be significant, and might as well go with the 3800xt to gain in daily usage comfort. If there won't be any noticeable difference, then 5600x could make more sense.

While I was at it, I swapped out my Arctic Liquid Freezer II 420 mounting brackets with the updated brackets that support offset mounting on my motherboard. I also used Arctic MX-5 thermal compound instead of MX-4. I'm seeing slightly over 40% improvement in Cinebench R23 scores; this makes me happy. 😊 

I was hesitant to upgrade for a few reasons:

* I had major USB and integrated audio issues up until AMD released AGESA 1.2.0.1 Patch A. This AGESA update resolved all my USB and audio issues on my 3900X. I am hoping I do not run into new USB/audio issues with the 5950X (I don't expect I will).
* I've read enough stories about poor shopping experiences with AMD. I ordered the CPU on AMD's online store. First, the product was available. Second, the ordering process went smoothly. Finally, I received the CPU crazy fast (\~44 hours from ordering to my door) and with no physical damage.
* I always hate pulling CPU coolers off, with fear of damaging pins on the old CPU or the socket itself if the cooler doesn't come off nicely. Fortunately, my CPU cooler cooperated and came off nicely. The cleanup with easy, too.
* Finally, I've seen plenty of posts about DOA chips or chips that produce WHEA errors, etc. I'm sure this is a tiny percentage of chips. My CPU seems to be working well, and standard XMP settings (just 3600) are running great.

Tried every update before that, every single one had a stuttering issue.

Working with 1 display does no difference.

AMD Ryzen 5 2600 Processor

GIGABYTE B450M DS3H

Corsair 8GBx2

Bios updated to the latest version, Windows updated to the latest version.

Honestly, I went throught everything, I dont know why this GPU keeps stuttering and lagging like crazy.

I uploaded a game that ran perfectly 15 years ago on my pentium 2 cual core.

What is going on with this GPU? what am i suppose to change settings?

HELP!

I'm looking for some help for the cooling of my computer because I run it a ""weird way"".

I own an arcade cab at home (a Vewlix) that I have been upgrading with a computer, 1440p screen etc. Now, I run a Radeon 6800 and a 5600x inside of it which gives me wonderful performances, but I'm a little bit affraid of heat.

&amp;#x200B;

[I haven't got any other picture at the moment, and will not be at home for a couple of days. \^\^](

The issue is ""the shape"" of the cab. Vewlix only have 2 ventilations (one in the back of the screen and one and one in the bottom), and the computer is mounted on a wood plate.

&amp;#x200B;

[Here's a little drawing that I did for a friend of mine couple of months ago, maybe it will be easier for the explanation, sorry if it's written in french...](

My main issue is, that when my computer gets hot, all the heat stays on the top of the cab, and goes really slow to be ejected. For the moment, I haven't got any issue, but in my opinion, if I could keep my motherboard cold, it would avoid a lot of problems and stress.

&amp;#x200B;

SOOOO, my question is : What is in your opinion the best way to cool all my stuff? Without having to make holes in the cab, even if it could be a solution if I don't find any other way to do it properly...

&amp;#x200B;

My main solution now would be to upgrade to a Noctua NH D15s, Corsair A500 or BeQuiet Dark Rock Pro 4 and see how it runs.

The thing is that I'm not able to see good comparatives of them. People are always talking about the noise, running them at 1000rpm,...

What I'd like is to buy the coolest of them, I don't care of sound at all because when you run an arcade cabinet, it always does sound.

The skylake's memory controller couldn't deal with it at clocks above 3200, even 3266 would just refuse to post regardless of timings or uncore voltage or whatever.

Cue friday, I bought a 5950X and a Gigabyte Aorus X570 Pro, rebuilt the system (carried over everything from the Intel rig except the CPU and mainboard, even the Noctua NH-D15), even the same install of Windows.

Ram worked at 3466Mhz CL16, which is the rated spec XMP/AMP SPD setting. Machine set my face on fire. 
decided to futz about a bit, ram was fine at 3600CL16.. ran that for most of Saturday and into Sunday morning.

My flesh was a bit singed at this point.

And right now, with apparent stability (obviously it's early days, soak testing is needed), that ram is doing 3733Mhz CL16, Infinity Fabric is 1:1 and this thing hauls more ass than I could possibly imagine. [(Geekbench- comparison baseline is with the ram at 3600CL16)](

There is but one issue, which is that there were no new shiny graphics cards available basically anywhere, so I'm using a GTX1080 still, not a bad card by any means, that's still entirely respectable.

From what I could gather on the AMD Help Subreddit (r/AMDHelp/) there are quite a few issues with the newer GPU's and some older ones. These series are the ones I see the most for black screen crashes, driver timeouts and green screen crashes.

* RX 500 series
* RX 5000 series
* RX 6000 series

Considering the amount of posts on AMD Help about this stuff I am wondering if these can be traced back to faulty hardware or faulty software. Rolling back to previous more stable versions seem to help alot, so this must be a software issue. 

These issues persisted for quite a while now and I personally would love to play newer games again, but the current GPU market also forces alot of people, like myself, to stick with bad drivers rather than RMA the card or get a better one, perhaps even from the competition. 

I have always been an AMD user and would love to continue, but these past months have been somewhat annoying and difficult to handle, especially with the time I had to put into troubleshooting.

But my PS4 is shot beyond repair and I'm not investing $300 to $450 into a used or new PS4 when the next gen has been out six months. I'm over chasing a PS5 &amp; am not waiting another year before they're readily available for purchase. So I decided I'd switch over to PC gaming and starting doing research to begin my first build. Leave it to me to get into something when prices are where they're at now. lol I decided to go with a build a YouTuber suggested as an intro build in this current market. It's using the Ryzen 3 3200G with no GPU. So I ordered everything, I went with

 [Phanteks PH-EC416PTG\_WT Eclipse P400 Steel ATX Mid Tower Case Glacier White, Tempered Glass Edition Cases]( 

I haven't opened anything. After doing more research, now I'm thinking I should not go with the 3200G with the integrated graphics, get a CPU that's a little more expensive with 6 or 8 cores and just overpay for an older perhaps used GPU. I've seen GPUs that aren't powerful by current standards, but are capable of performing better than the 3200G for prices in the $150 range. So my thinking is, if I pay $75 or so more for a CPU with 6 -8 cores then find a cheap graphics card I'd have a rig that may perform a little better than the 3200G, but it would be muck easier to upgrade. I could just buy a more powerful GPU when the market levels out. Seems like using the 3200G with no GPU I'm building a rig for $550 - $600 that is on or behind par with a PS4 which I could find used for $250 with some looking around. With the build I have now, wouldn't I need to replace the 3200G when I got a graphics card? If I could just add a GPU without needing to upgrade the 3200G, then this build is cool. I assumed the 3200G wouldn't suffice because a lot of its processing power is sacrificed for the integrated graphics. Forgive my ignorance, again, I've just jumped into the world of PC gaming. So what do you all think I should do? I'd love to think it'd be okay to just add a GPU to this 3200G build I have now because I'm dying to begin my first build, especially since it's all sitting right here in my room.

Am intending to buy Thinkcentre M75q Tiny Gen 2 PC.

The only difference between these two cpu that I found is that 4700GE has unlocked multiplier (for overclocking whatever I guess) and other doesn't.

Is it possible to boost the igpu performance with this specific machine by overclocking or is it just pointless?  Especially with the stock cooler.

Am not much of a overclocking guy but like to try a bit to boost the igpu performance a little.

4750GE costs 50 AUD more but the benchmarks seems identical so am not sure if its worth the extra cost and the locked CPU. If there are any specific benefits to this CPU then please let me know.

1,10,0,1,0,"6700xt Build vs Xbox Series X resultsI know these kinds of tests aren't really conclusive on the capabilities of hardware, but I'm currently enjoying my PC build over the new Xbox. I'm fortunate enough to have picked up a new console and new card, so for fun I'll compare some games. 6700xt is paired with a Ryzen 5 3600x. Most games I set a limit to 120fps to prevent drops because I'm having issues with freesync on my Odyssey G7. 

Star Wars Battlefront II, I slept on this game and it's actually a lot fun. With the new FPS boost on Xbox, it seems to run at 1080p120fps. Definitely a drop in clarity, I enjoyed 4K60fps better on the big screen. 

The 6700xt build ran the game at 1440p 120fps max settings no problem. Plus you get adjustable FOV and other settings.

Battlefield V, same results. Way more to tinker with on PC, so I got 1440p solid 120fps maxed out. Turns out I really suck at this game though. 

Rocket Leauge is interesting. On Xbox, it runs at a resolution between 1440p and 4K at 120fps. So the game looks great and runs great. On PC, I got 1440p and a whopping 240fps. Enough said. 

Apex Legends is 1440p 60fps on Xbox. I'm geussing this is because there's no optimization for new consoles, but still a bit dissapointing. On PC, 1440p and 120fps pretty steady. 

None of these games are very new so it'll be interesting to test new titles. I have Game Pass Ultimate / EA Play for PC and Xbox so if anyone has any recommendations for games to benchmark, I'm really into shooters, action games, sci fi / fantasy.",xt build v xbox series x resultsi know kind test really conclusive capability hardware currently enjoying build xbox fortunate enough picked console card fun compare game xt paired ryzen x game set limit fps prevent drop issue freesync odyssey g star war battlefront ii slept game actually lot fun fps boost xbox seems run p fps definitely drop clarity enjoyed k fps better big screen xt build ran game p fps max setting problem plus get adjustable fov setting battlefield v result way tinker got p solid fps maxed turn really suck game though rocket leauge interesting xbox run resolution p k fps game look great run great got p whopping fps enough said apex legend p fps xbox geussing optimization console still bit dissapointing p fps pretty steady none game interesting test title game pas ultimate ea play xbox anyone recommendation game benchmark really shooter action game sci fi fantasy

I suppose realistically to max that out means going Intel but I'm done with them and would rather go AMD. First time since Athlon 64.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I read that this memory needs the X570 Dark Hero or Godlike to perform to spec. So now, unless anyone knows better, I'm stuck getting the Dark Hero. But I like the MSI B550 Gaming Edge - will it perform on this board?

Also some have said and even the press release says that a 1 CCX CPU is better for running this RAM. So I would have to avoid the 5900X and get the 5800X?

1,10,0,1,0,"2700x to 5800x for Warzone 1080p 144+fps (speculative upgrade thoughts)Hello All,

I just wanted to get your thoughts on a speculative upgrade I thought about which could grant me the 140 to 160 fps I want to play this game.

Currently my mini build is a x470i Asus motherboard, 2700x (PBO on at 4.1ghz across board when playing Cod), 16gb 3400hz cl 16 16 memory, and an overclocked 1070ti (+750 memory +140 core - which is getting close to a 2060 super. 

As of present I am getting between 90 to 120 fps in warzone games (depends on map area but my average would be around 105 fps) , at 1440p with 85% render scale on all low settings except medium textures. 

At 85% render my gpu is working fully ( hovers between 95 to 99% usage) most of the times.

I want to increase my fps to get between 140 to 160 as I have an 165hz 1440p screen and I really don't care about the graphics. 

 If I reduce the render scale down to 75% which would be equal to 1080p scaling, there is no increase in the fps which tells me the cpu is bottleneck ing and the gpu usage drops to 70-80%.

So my conclusion is that if I would upgrade my 2700x to a 5900x that would give me a significant upgrade in frames at 1080p render scale up to the point where my gpu would bottleneck. 

Thing is, I don't know how many fps this move would grant me to try it. I believe my current overclocked gpu would be able to grant 140 to 160 fps at 1080p with a 5900x in hand based on benchmarks I have seen. Any thoughts?

*edit 1: buying a gpu wouldn't be a reasonable option now now due to market prices and also having seen benchmark videos where 2700x pair with rtx 3 series still bottlenecks at around 110fps due to cpu bottleneck. 

TLDR; will upgrading from a 2700x to 5900x together with an overclocked 1070ti  increase my fps at 1080p low from 110 to 140-150?

Thank you.

[

The Noctua is INSANELY better. It is NOT close. With the Freezer 50 I was worried about thermal throttle, with temps peaking at 85C with the limit being 90C for my 5900x.

With the Noctua, I can have Cinebench running for 10 min, in a hot room, running ""npm install"" and opening Android Studio and I cannot push my temps above 62C. I have tried. The fan doesn't even bother throttling up when I run Cinebench. It's just like, ""yeah bud I'll whir some if you find something hot to put me on, but I don't feel anything hot nearby, but let me know"". Noctua gives no shits. And it's completely silent. Like, I'm straight up wondering if I'm deaf right now.

I managed to get my hands on one of these units, and promptly set about taking it apart to get a look at the PCB itself and check for potential waterblock compatibility. My hopes weren't exactly high, as the pictures on Sapphire's website made it pretty obvious that the PCB was at least somewhat different than the other Nitro+ cards. However, I wasn't expecting to find an exact match to the Toxic PCB (picture from IgorsLab review [here](

In my opinion, this gives an interesting look at how an AIB might handle branding and market segmentation. As a consequence of the new XTXH version of the 6900XT chip making its way into the new version of the Toxic ""Ultimate Edition"", I wonder if Sapphire will cease making XTX ""Limited Edition"" versions of the Toxic card. They may be replacing it with this new Nitro+ option that it appears is inheriting these XTX chips and their PCBs. The choice to brand these as Nitro+ indicates to me that Sapphire is very concerned about keeping the Toxic label associated with absolute top-tier performance, even if that means having wacky chimera products like the Nitro+ SE to fill product line gaps.",sapphire special edition nitro xt card actually air cooled toxic pcbs picture managed get hand one unit promptly set taking apart get look pcb check potential waterblock compatibility hope exactly high picture sapphire website made pretty obvious pcb least somewhat different nitro card however expecting find exact match toxic pcb picture igorslab review opinion give interesting look aib might handle branding market segmentation consequence xtxh version xt chip making way version toxic ultimate edition wonder sapphire cease making xtx limited edition version toxic card may replacing nitro option appears inheriting xtx chip pcbs choice brand nitro indicates sapphire concerned keeping toxic label associated absolute top tier performance even mean wacky chimera product like nitro se fill product line gap

I received my new GPU yesterday and I wittnessed some strange behavior:

Whatever I do, I don't get this GPU over more than 186W power consumption. I am tracking via HWinfo and RTSS/Afterburner. I tested several games in different high settings, FurMark, 3D Spy. It just won't go above 186W. In the AMD software I set it to standard = 186W. I set it to GPU overclock = 196W but not more.

In all tests and reviews I read about a power consumption of 230W. Am I missing something?

1,27,0,1,0,"Inifinity Cache speculation (input would be appreciated)In a discussion elsewhere someone asked if Rembrandt might have Infinity Cache. After some thinking I decided that the answer will be 'yes'. However, I'm a software developer, not an ASIC designer, so my guesses may be wide off the mark. I figured that I'd post them here because I know that there are people here who are more knowledgeable than me on the subject.

Also, if anyone has any link to articles or patents which clarify the nature of Infinity Cache, then please post them. A google search about AMD cache brings up either the chiplet cache patent or the ""Shared L1 Caches"" one.

**The nature of Infinity Cache**

The one thing which to me is unique about Infinity Cache is its layout. I'm used to seeing rectangular caches, at a central position. Here we have a cache that's layed out as long strips, with some bumps, on the outside of the die.

My guess about why this is possible is that GPUs are less sensitive to latency, so the physical location of the data matters less. It's possible that this also affects what kind of bus can be used. Perhaps Infinity Cache is called so because it's connected via Infinity Fabric.

My other guess is about the benefit: the ability to use areas of the chip which would normally have no transistors, only routing. As I understand it, a chip's floorplan is made from a few large blocks which are stuffed together on a die, and since they don't always fit perfectly together, there's some space left. If there's a block that doesn't have to have a particular shape, it could be used to fill those spaces.

I understand that a cache would also affect power density, and general power usage, but perhaps the use or layout of this cache helps in that, or the reduction in RAM access more than compensates for it, in the case of a GPU.

**Application to Rembrandt**

If the above assumptions are correct (which is the big question), then I assume that APUs have spaces that aren't used and could be filled with a GPU-specific L3 cache.

One possible reason not to do it would be higher power use, but I assume that: (a) this cache will be smaller than the 16MB L3 CPU cache, so will take relatively little power; (b) the 6nm process will help; (c) even if it leads to higher power consumption, that's only an issue for heavy GPU processing, and when budgeting for power could still be made beneficial when the GPU is used.

So my conclusion was that it's likely for Rembrandt to have some Infinity Cache, even if it's a rather small amount, like 4MB, because it has little cost and some performance benefit.

I had ordinary office 1080p monitor from DELL, 60Hz, nothing fancy. Two weeks ago i have purchased a ""gaming"" monitor DELL S2721DGF and since then i'm experiencing issues. This new monitor is certified for FreeSync Premium Pro with HDR400 certification.

First it was RE Village with driver 21.4.1 and 21.5.1. Then it was Doom Eternal on 21.5.1 and 21.5.2, now it's Remnant from the Ashes on 21.5.2 from GamePass. Previous games were on Steam.

Symptoms are simple, really = Instant computer reboot. I happens randomly in all games. After 10 min or after one hour. Then i can play 2 hours straight and nothing happens. Then it reboots randomly again after some time.

Is this a feature of the FreeSync Premium Pro specification? Can HDR cause these issues? Btw. RE Village and Doom Eternal looks nice with HDR, clearly visible improvement even if it's not premium HDR 1000 experience. Remnant does not support HDR, capped at V-Sync 60Hz it just rebooted my PC on first tutorial mission.

Anyway, i'm running my monitor on 120Hz and now i remember that even Grim Dawn has crashed once or twice, but no hard reboot like the other games. Also with this new DELL monitor i have noticed at 60Hz power draw 30 watt. With custom refresh rate like 61Hz or my current 120Hz is power draw ""normal"" around 10 watt..

I have no UV/UC at this moment, running clean installation of Windows 10 21H1 just released with driver 21.5.2. Eventlog is not helpful, stating the obvious that previous system shutdown was unexpected..

I recently purchased a pre-built refurbished PC from Newegg (specs: AMD Ryzen 5 3600 3.20GHz, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD, AMD Radeon RX 5000 series, Windows 10 Pro). It said ""gaming,"" but it's constantly lagging and freezing during gameplay. Before buying, I checked the FPS benchmarks, and it should deliver at least 30 FPS in World of Warcraft or GTAIV, yet it's overheating and roaring so loud I'm afraid it'll die on me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I contacted Newegg, and they told me that my expectations for FPS weren't their responsibility. The PC works fine otherwise, so the lags aren't something they can help me with. As I see it, I currently have two options - look for a new GPU or somehow fix the one I have. 

I've upgraded drivers to the latest version I could find, 466.27, but it didn't help. Maybe I should replace the fan or thermal paste? I'd prefer to fix it because I think it'll be cheaper than splurging on a new GPU. 

But if it's unfixable, I'll obviously have to look for a new one that fits my pretty tight budget of $100. I've searched for ones from this list [ but most of them are either ""currently unavailable"" or refurbished (I sure as hell not buying anything refurbished anymore).

&amp;#x200B;

I'd really appreciate any advice or tips on fixing my 1030 because I'd prefer this option over spending more money while having an otherwise working GPU. Maybe some drivers can get it up to snuff? Will the fan replacement actually help, or it'll be a waste of money?

* In MSI Afterburner I see GPU Temperature and GPU Temperature 2. What is GPU Temperature 2?
* I'm importing CPU (Die) Average sensor reading from HWInfo to get it in MSI OSD. Does MSI now offer correct CPU temp reading? Is it the same reading as HWInfo?
* I'm also using CPU Usage and CPU Clock from MSI Afterburner, are those an average of all-cores usage and clock? Can I rely on them instead of having per core reading?
* What's the difference between CPU Temperature/Usage/Clock and CPU Temperature/Usage/Clock n (where n is the number of core)?

I think those are all my questions for now. Any help would be really appreciated.

Go to device manager and disable any ""AMD Radeon (TM) USB LED"" under the Human Interface Devices tree.

The 6900xt was lighting up with fans spinning so I unplugged the display port cable and plugged it back in.  It started just fine so I assumed I didn’t have it plugged in all the way originally and felt a bit dumb.

Performance was great.  Thermals were good, benchmarks were very good (RDR2, AC Odyssey) No issues at all except for TW3 oddly enough which had some strange stutters/fps drops.  Everything seemed fine until this morning when I tried starting it up and was met with grey static covering my monitor.  Sort of like an old tv and if you looked close enough you could actually some color in the static.

I turned it off and tried adjusting the display port cable again.  It started fine and after more testing, even more benchmarking and multiple restarts I can’t replicate the issue.  Normally I would think it obviously had something to do with the cable, but I hadn’t adjusted the cable from the night before when it was working perfectly and I’ve never had any issues like this before on my 1070.

I used DDU to remove Nvidia drivers beforehand and installed all the proper drivers/software for the 6900xt.  SAM is not enabled and the gpu bios is set to balanced.

5950x, MSI MEG x570 Godlike motherboard, RTX 3090, Samsung 980 Pro SSD, Sabrent Rocket Q4 SSD

Applied latest MSI UEFI update that includes AGESA [1.2.0.2](  Set everything back to PCIe 4.0.  Still have issues with USB resets, primarily on USB headset and webcam.  Explorer.exe also had issues with hanging during the USB device resets.  Doesn't matter which USB ports they're plugged into, doesn't matter if it's through a hub or directly into the motherboard.  

Setting things back to PCIe Gen 3 fixes about 90-95% of the resets/drop-outs, but not all of them.

To mitigate I ended up installing a USB 3.2 Gen 2 add-in card and setting only that slot to PCIe Gen 3 while leaving other slots and the chipset in Gen 4.  All USB devices are now going through the AIC in Gen 3.  So far that seems to have resolved the problem, though it's only been in for a few days.

Below is AMD's response to the ticket I submitted this week.  It's obviously a canned response, but it clearly admits they're aware of the issue and that it isn't fixed.

\--------------------

Thank you for your email.

I am sorry to hear that you are experiencing USB connectivity issues with your AMD 500 Series chipset motherboard.

The intent was to run at spec with the FCLK and MCLK set to 1:1, so they will be 1800/3600

I have recently read that using all 4 slots will actually reduce the clock rate of the RAMs. Even when the spec says 3600Mhz, putting 4x can reduce the default rate below that.

So  I recently ordered a Ryzen 5 5600X from Alternate (btw, they have a  bundle in stock with the cpu, MSI B550 A Pro mobo and 16gb of 3200 Mhz  ram for a very competitive price, if you're in Europe), and while  scrolling on AMD's website I noticed that the maximum RAM clock  supported by the CPU is 3200 MHz. Now I am a bit confused about this:  will installing 3600 MHz or higher RAM in the system still result in  better performance on the Zen 3 platform or would it be pointless? Amd's  website states the same supported RAM clocks for the 5800X btw.

Most of the info and reviews about this ram kits on youtube(by reviewers and others) are from 2019 and talk about it being Rev E DUAL RANK ONLY(for the 32gb 2x16 kit); since october 2020 Crucial has been ''scamming?'' customers about this by NOT properly disclossing that the kits they are selling now (UNDER THE SAME MODEL NUMBER!!!!) are single rank trash and not dual rank.

Their amazon listings has been recieving negative reviews about this since they never disclosed this, forums on reddit have gotten tons of negative posts about this and we've seen zero coverage from popular reviewers and sites about this ''SCAM''

**Isn't it illegal to sell 2 different ram types under the same model number??** which perform differently in many workloads due to it being **single rank(shit) vs dual rank(awesome).** 16GB Single Rank modules(trash) should never be sold under the same model number and listings as   
16GB Dual rank(good).

**THIS IS A WARNING** for anyone wanting to get Crucial ballistix 32gb(2x16) Ram kits for their systems. You may never get that as Crucial does not disclose this.

1,13,0,1,0,"Should I keep my 5900x or return it? (Upgrading from 3900x)Hey everyone,

A few months ago, I built my system and had to settle on a 3900x as the 5900x wasn't in stock anywhere. A couple of weeks ago I got an alert on a parts finder discord server for a 5900x and immediately jumped to buy it. I just received it and am now contemplating whether or not I should swap them.

In terms of usage my rig gets, I have it mainly for motion graphics, 3D modeling/rendering and video editing. I also play Destiny 2 pretty much exclusively. Here is a full parts list:

&amp;#x200B;

MSI x570 Tomahawk MB

AMD 3900x CPU

EVGA 3080 FTW3 Ultra GPU

Lian Li Lancool II Mesh Case

Noctua NH-D15 CPU Cooler

3x Lian Li 120 Bora Digital Case Fans

Corsair RM 850x 80+ Gold PSU

16GBx2 (32GB) HyperX Fury 3600Mhz RAM

1TB WD Blue 2.5"" SATA3 SSD

500GB WD Black SN750 NVMe SSD

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is: for my usage, is it worth swapping these out? I understand on the gaming side I won't see that noticeable of a difference, but potentially in the rendering and video editing? Or is it worth waiting for the Zen4 AM5 socket type and upgrade my motherboard at the same time, saving $880 CAD after tax right now where I can either return it, or find someone locally who can benefit from it as actually landing one of these is almost impossible?

Since the TDP is the same as the 2700X, and the prism worked well cooling the 2700X, I figured it would work fine for the 5800X as well.  I built the 5800X PC in a Silverstone SUGO 14 case with a temporary RX 480 (until 6700 or 6800 becomes available and at normal prices).  It is running HOT.  Idles around 50-55 C, spikes to 60-70 C doing barely anything (chrome, file explorer, etc.) and thermal throttles when running a game (hits 90-91C).  Other temps in the case are normal (except the GPU runs a little hot, also hitting 90C, but whatever).  No PBO or OC, everything is stock.  Is this a bad CPU or is the cooler just not capable of cooling it?

&amp;#x200B;

1,14,0,1,0,"5700xt Reference Watercool for quiet Gaming (Buying advice)Hello,

i have a reference 5700xt card. Since the updates from last year, the blower cooler is enough to make the job. But the cost for this is the fan noise volume. I wanted to buy a new GPU, but they are not available for the regular price. Only option would be water cooling it. Is the ""Alphacool Eiswolf 240 GPX Pro"" better in Cooling down the temperatures (Memory and Tj) and at being quiet? I heard the pumpnoise could be as much as loud as the blower fan and the temperatures of the memory would be even higher. Where is it just myth and what are the facts?

I know i have the performance already, but a complete custom waterloop would cost about 500€. Thats more than the price of a new 6700xt (which i can't buy). I dont want to waste above 300€.

I dont play very much gpu heavy games, but the noise is a real ambient killer when i once decide to play Witcher 3 or Tomb Raider on high settings. The noise is a lot lower since the updates, but in stressful days i just want to Game in silence (Like my idle noise amount 30 db).

When I run the single core test, the core being used jumps around too fast for one core to peg. I'm seeing it jump all over, instead of staying on one core.

It's a dusty environment (warehouse) so keep that in mind. Airflow shouldn't be a problem either. Just need small PC boxes and touch screens to aid input.

1,1,0,1,0,"I believe I am having some sort of GPU or DirectX Issue. 

**I believe there is something wrong with my DirectX.**  


Multiple games I regularly (Modern Warfare 2019, Overwatch, Apex Legends, Escape From Tarkov, Forza Horizon 4, and lately it seems like every game I try) have been crashing a lot recently. Typically these crashes have some sort of error relating to DirectX, typically Dev Error 6068 and error 0x887a0006 for Modern Warfare, and DXGI\_ERROR\_Device\_HUNG for Apex Legends, and I'm at my wit's end for what's wrong. I've been having this issue for a bit and ended up having to RMA my GPU due to a crash causing my displays not to function and ended being sent an entirely new card but the issues still continue.  


**So far I have tried:**

* Overclocking both GPU and CPU (one site said this would fix one of the errors) (I also wonder if ram could be the issue if so how could I check that?)
* I have tried replacing thermal paste (one site said an error could be heat related though I haven't noticed thermal throttling)  

* I have tried undervolting my GPU
* I have completely reinstalled the games, my drivers, and windows (windows 3 times now)
* I have reverted to older drivers that I know the game worked properly on.
* I have updated Bios and Chipsets.
* I have tried default Bios settings.
* And I have tried running the games as admin as well.

**Extra Info:**

* The crashing doesn't seem to be consistent always specifically for Call of Duty sometimes it's whenever I finish a match, sometimes it's when I first join a match, and sometimes it's right after I get to the main menu after launching.
* Oh and I also sometimes get a pop-up from the AMD software stating a driver timeout has occurred.
* When looking at event viewer errors relating to these games come up as Application hang with the Hang type being Top level window is idle.
* Forza simply freezes then crashes to desktop idk what is causing that one.

**System Specs:**

* CPU Ryzen 5 1600X
* RAM G.Skillz Ripjaws V 32GB @ 3000Mhz
* GPU RX 5700XT THICC III (was originally THICC II but was sent THICC III after RMA)

Moved the T180's motherboard to an older Athlon XP 3200+ era HP Pavillion a700n case to go with the Matching Keyboard, Mouse, Speakers and 17"" CRT Monitor. (Did it more to make the system more compatible with my Windows 10 network in the house a bit easier as the Atlon XP CPU system was too weak for Win 10) It was basically done up as a Memorial theme as the HP system was a grandparent's system until shortly before he passed.

Just not sure what to use either of them for these days until I get more large capacity drives to use for a Storage system.

AMD approved the RMA of the Ryzen 3200G and sent me a brand new one in short order.

Regular crashing to a green screen and then rebooting. I finally found a stable driver from May of 2020 year and following another user's advice also underclocked the card by 2%. It's been working pretty well, but there are still some games (X4 Foundations) that threaten to crash if I run them along with other things like a twitch stream.(screens flicker, and at that point I know I have to shut the game down or risk another crash)

All this said, I just got an email from AMD stating a new driver was released, and was wondering about how stable it is, or if there are still crashing issues with the 5700XT? I'm just wanting to ask so I don't upgrade my driver's and find myself in a similar spot as the other month.

To be clear, my card before this was an R9 390, and besides the one and final time it failed and kicked the bucket, it ran flawlessly and I never had crashing issues like I have with the 5700XT.

1,3,0,1,0,"VR Performance of the 6900XT with latest driversSo i got a ""fairly good deal"" on a 6900xt last month. Because of time constraints i only got around to the test the card last weekend in VR and i was fairly underwhelmed. Atleast with HL:Alyx and the GTA V real mod(I havent got around to test further titles because i troubleshooted both titles since then). Performance really wasnt something you'd expect from a 1000$/€ card.

Considering the card should fire up an Index with 144hz in HL:Alyx on Ultra i was really weirded out my card couldnt even hold 80fps with my Facebook Rift S. Also GTA5 real mod felt much sloppier than on the 5700xt i used use before that.

So far i got HL:Alyx running as expected by reverting back to the Adrenalin 21.3.1 Driver. Not super excited about it but its a fairly easy fix.

The real mod stills runs absolutly horrible. Even with the low settings provided by the mod i average 60fps at best. With high settings which should be the go to for such an expensive card it drops down to 30fps. Not great for the stomach considering that the mod uses alternate eye rendering. Dont get me wrong it cant be expected that an unofficial mod runs perfectly out of the box but i'm still a bit bummed about it. 

I dont really know where i want to go with my post now really. But if you also experience bad performance with VR title i suggest you revert back to Adrenalin 21.3.1 and maybe somebody else also found a way to run the GTA V real mod on Big Navi somewhat performant? I expect some issue with the fairly aggresive powersaving plan which kicks in because of the alternate eye rendering. Clocks and usage are jumping all over the place when running the game.

PS btw Pancake performance is pretty great and as expected. Also the card suits me in that regard really well because i still run 1080p monitors and am not too excited about the current state of raytracing.

## Radeon Software Adrenalin 21.5.2 Highlights

## Support For

* Days Gone
* Microsoft® DirectX® 12 Agility SDK &amp; Microsoft® Shader Model 6.6
   * Learn more from AMD [here]( and Microsoft [here](

## Fixed Issues

* Uninstalling or upgrading Radeon Software using the factory reset option may delete AMD chipset driver folders if they are stored in the same directory as the Radeon Software installation. Users who wish to perform a factory reset are recommended to use the latest AMD cleanup utility instead.
* Cyberpunk 2077™ may experience shadow corruption on Radeon RX 6000 series graphics when ray tracing is enabled.
* Intermittent loss of signal during AMD Link’s Stream Optimization if HEVC is used on Radeon RX 5000 series graphics products or later.
* The download or launch Ryzen Master buttons in Radeon Software may intermittently disappear or may fail to initialize Ryzen Master.
* FPS logging may log incorrectly or fail to log on RyzenTM Mobile 4000 series and RyzenTM Mobile 5000 series.
* Radeon Software may experience a crash when Record &amp; Stream tab is in use and a display is hot plugged.

## Known Issues

* Radeon™ Software might not get updated on Windows 7 platforms when updating from 21.4.1 or 21.5.2 to this release, if factory reset is enabled. As a workaround, users who wish to perform a factory reset are recommended to use the latest AMD cleanup utility instead.
* Resident Evil Village™ may experience an intermittent application hang or TDR on AMD Radeon VII graphics products in the first mission of the game.
* Enhanced Sync may cause a black screen to occur when enabled on some games and system configurations. Any users who may be experiencing issues with Enhanced Sync enabled should disable it as a temporary workaround.
* Connecting two displays with large differences in resolution/refresh rates may cause flickering on Radeon RX Vega series graphics products.
* Radeon performance metrics and logging features may intermittently report extremely high and incorrect memory clock values.
* Radeon FreeSync™ may intermittently become locked while on desktop after performing task switching between extended and primary displays upon closing a game, causing poor performance or stuttering. A system restart is a potential workaround if this is experienced.
* If Ryzen Master is not detected in Adrenalin software after installation, a system restart may be required.
* If Blue or Black screen is observed in mobile systems, temporarily disable Enhanced sign-in

## AMD Link for Windows Known Issues

* Intermittent grey frame corruption might be observed when streaming with HEVC on certain configurations via an Internet connection. A workaround is to use the AVC encoding setting instead.

this is my first post on r/Amd.

I was searching for a new cooler, to keep my Ryzen 5 3600 under 90°C when running at 100% Cpu load for rendering and mechanical simulations. So I ended up buying a used wraith prism for 5€. Although this wasnt a big upgrade from the stock cooler, I decided to try some overclocking.

I just followed a tutorial on YouTube which told me 1.28 Volts is safe, so I put in 1.28v and started increasing the frequence from 3.6 to 4.2 to 4.3 to 4.4 and finally to 4.5 where my pc crashed during the stress test. So I put in 4.45GHz and it ran flawless since then.

Cinebench R23 scores are:

Multic Core: 10268 --&gt; 96.8°C max

Single Core: 1319

My questions now are: Is it safe to increase the Voltage, how much would I have to increase it to get my pc running stable on 4.5GHz and would it even be worth it?

1,9,0,1,0,"Overclocking Question on 5600xI recently got a 5600x. I have played around with PBO, Curve Optimizer, and straight up fixed multiplier.

Currently I am running PBO with curve optimizer. The settings are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

* PBO Limits: Mobo
* PBO Scalar: 1X
* Curve Optimizer: negative 5,5,10,15,15 (with -5 on my best 2 threads)
* Max Core Boost override: 300Mhz
* Thermal throttle Limit: 90 deg

I then also set a vcore voltage offset of -0.2v. I had to do this because just running PBO with Curve Optimizer was pushing temps into the 70s and pushing VID to 1.45v

In game (with RTSS and HWINFO) I am measuring 4,850Mhz all core at around 1.22v and my temp stays at around 50deg (balanced mode).

So my questions are:

\- Is the core clock maxing out at 4,850 due to only setting 300 on the boost override (and somehow AMD interprets it as 4,850 and not 4,900)?

\- Would curve optimizer still be used by the mobo even if I have a vcore voltage offset? I have noticed that in-game all my cores are pushing the same voltage at the max frequency which I would not have expected if curve optimizer was being used.

\- How do I get curve optimizer to work better so that I don't have to set a static vcore offset? Is it as simple as just increasing the neg values in the optimizer until I find the limit? I just don't understand why the mobo would push so much volts to the core unless required.

Setup as follows:

* Mobo: asus tuf gaming plus (x570)
* CPU: 5600x
* GPU: Asus rtx2080 super oc
* RAM: XPG spectrix 3200mhz (xmp enabled)

The thing is I want to add a 2nd PCI-E Gen 4 M.2 to the other bay. This one goes through the same chipset that the bulk of the USB stuff is run through. (Want another fast drive for more games.)

So my question is, is anyone rocking 2 M.2s Gen4s with the current BIOS? Are you experiencing any USB drop out issues with both M.2s at Gen 4 with a Gen 4 GPU?",question msi x tomahawk mb user series processor pci e gen cpu x gpu rtx like many battling usb issue board eventually resolved issue bios update switching usb powered hub fastest sabrant rocket tb right noticed stuff dropping gpu working overtime time thing want add nd pci e gen bay one go chipset bulk usb stuff run want another fast drive game question anyone rocking gen current bios experiencing usb drop issue gen gen gpu

The final step would then be deleting the DirectX shader cache through disk cleanup, re-enabling the shader cache and restarting again.

After that, it is fine unless the computer then sleeps after not being on for some time ( its a gaming laptop) and when usually a spacebar tap should turn it on it goes black screen again.

I bought a brand new 5800X for a NR200 Gaming rig and Gigabyte B550i Aorus Pro AX (thankfully it was updated to F10 Bios with Ryzen 5000 support OOB). 

Besides it being a hot boi it produces WHEA 18 and 19. 

I am using crucial ballistix sport lt micron rev e 3200MHz Dual Rank 2x16GB. Those sticks did run in my x570 3900X system without a sweat at 3800MHz. I run testmem5 extreme profiles for hours at 3600MHz and don’t get errors in testmem5, but hwinfo64 shows errors. Checking windows I did get some whea 19. BiOS is the latest beta, even tried the one before over the weekend.

It’s impossible to not get whea on this gigabyte - even on 3200MHz and tighter timings 14-17-14-14-32. I tried all the voltages on ram, I have good airflow on an open bench with extra fans. 

I did use XMP profile with bios default settings on cyberpunk and forza. Cyberpunk crashes, sometimes system reboots. Forza horizon 4 blue screens whea within minutes of driving a car.

PSU I tried: 600w platinum sf600, rm850x gold. 
Two sets of ram. Only thing I could try is the x570 but I kinda need that 3900X working.

1,84,0,1,0,"AMD GPU Pro Tip: In Adrenaline set Tessellation mode to ""Override application settings,"" and Maximum Tessellation level to ""16x"" or lower. AMD graphics cards don't handle tessellation as well as nVidia's do, turning the setting down might gain you a few FPS, without compromising visual fidelity.You might remember a few years ago when AMD created a hair graphics library called TressFX, it worked well on AMD cards and it worked actually even a little bit better on nVidia cards, too.  

nVidia, not to be outdone, came up with their own hair graphics package called HairWorks, and it ran incredibly well on nVidia GPUs, but absolutely destroyed performance on AMD GPUs.  
  
After a little bit of sleuthing it was discovered that nVidia had cranked HairWorks tessellation up to an absurd amount, like 64x, which not only didn't provide any additional visual fidelity to the hair, but had the added bonus of exploiting one of the weaknesses of their competitor's products.  The solution was a simple one, though: Go into the AMD control panel (Then Catalyst, now Adrenaline) and manually turn the tessellation setting down.  
  
WCCFTech: [The Witcher 3 – How to Run HairWorks on AMD GPUs Without Crippling Performance](  
  
AMD cards can handle Tessellation levels of anywhere from 2x to 16x pretty well, and there really isn't much *subjective visual improvement* after 16x anyway, at least not in current modern games, and I run my Vega 64 at 8x tessellation without a problem.  I set the tessellation level globally, then if I'm having any problems, or just want the redundancy, I'll go in and create a game specific profile as well.

1,31,0,1,0,"A noob seeking some clarity on undervolting/overclocking his 5900xHi guys,
So I recently purchased a Ryzen 5900x (motherboard is an Aorus x570 Master with BIOS F33j and cooler is an NZXT Kraken X73 360mm). I am very new to overclocking and undervolting so I read a lot of posts on /r/AMD, /r/GigabyteGaming etc to at least get a basic grasp of what I'm getting myself into and how to go about doing this the right way. After catching up with all that, I experimented a lot and landed on these PBO settings:

**PBO Limits: Motherboard

PBO Scalar: 3x

Boost clock override: 50MHz

CO: -30 all core

Thermal Limits: 90
**

and on my motherboard, I did these:

**CPU LLC: Turbo

SOC LLC: Turbo

Spread spectrun control: Disabled

Global C-state control: Disabled

AMD Cool&amp;Quiet Mode: Disabled

CPU Vcore current protection: Extreme

CPU Vcore protection: 400mV

CPU Vcore SOC current protection: 400mV

PWM Phase control: Extreme performance

CPPC: Enabled

CPPC preferred cores: Enabled
**

Now, as I read stability testing is very crucial, I read up on that as well and got to know about Cinebench (20/23), Prime95, OCCT, Y-cruncher and AIDA64. So, I ran OCCT for 1hr (the free version only allows that) and got no BSODs/reboots. Next, I found out about this handy script called ""CoreCycler"" and using that, I ran both AIDA64 and Prime95.

For Prime95, I turned on AVX (not AVX2), set it to 2 threads, selected the Smallest FFT preset (as I read this is the best for stability testing), set the script running time to auto (which tests all FFT sizes in the selected preset) and ran the script for 8 iterations and got no reboots/BSODs. Similarly, for AIDA64, I ran the script for 10m per core and enbaled AVX and no problems here as well.

Now for CB20/23, though they both ran properly for both single and multi core, I am getting quite low scores (~7800 MC in CB20 and ~19K MC in CB23) and I suspect this is due to the really high undervolt (-30) that I did. But regarding the curve optimizer, I've read a 3 mixed things:

1. Some people say to undervolt your best/second-best cores the highest as they are the most efficient ones and set a lower UV to your worst cores so they can boost properly.
2. Some others say the exact opposite of point 1.
3. Yet others actually say to give a small positive offset to your best cores as they can use that voltage to boost higher frequencies.

Thus, I'm really torn regarding these 3 statements and so I ask you guys to tell me which one is the appropriate thing to follow (or if it is somehow a situational thing that depends on your chip's binning) so that I can further tune my curve properly as imho, all-core UV is simply not the way. I can see people here posting scores that average between 21K MC in CB23 so I at least want to land somewhere near that (I know running after scores is worthless but I think mine is simply too low due to the worse undervolting I did).

Also, please advice me on proper stability testing as I, being new to all of this could've very well done it all wrong.

Anyone had experience with a good ITX board that supports wifi and bluetooth, as well as the 3600 out of the box (or at least does not need a previous gen cpu to update the bios)? Also do these boards have WiFi card slots?

But I think getting a ""CPU fan error"" in the BIOS when your custom water-cooled CPU is less than 40 deg. C is a bit silly in 2021. As someone who tweaks and resets their BIOS often, this error is not just annoying but stupid as well.

Likewise, in Radeon Software, it would be great to modify or replace the fan control curve section of the Performance Tuning section to more accurately reflect your cooling situation.

I am fucking tired of this shit. Warzone is well known for being poorly optimized for pc. Now in my case I never had any issued within almost the first year of playing the game. At some point i started getting fps issues. Usually i could run the game 90-100 fps at 1080p and almost maxed graphics. Tbh results varied slightly based on how i adjusted graphics settings. For some reason, my game started stuttering in a way that made it completely unplayable. I read a thread that advised me to change the games priority in task manager’s details i believe. Its usually set to “high” and it should be “normal” at least. I dont understand what it had to do with, but it worked. At least to my recollection, i think it solved the porblem... temporarily. I kept getting problems, so then i decided to do a factory reset. I wiped my pc clean and it all got fixed. But after i installed my amd driver (adrenalin) i started getting issues again. If i have it uninstalled, its nowhere nearly as fucked up. The game would run smoothly, whether i had vsync on or off with my fps capped  at any number or unlimited. But once i had my driver installed, every 10 seconds my game stutters. It is fucking annoying. I have no clue on what to do. Of course i can just keep the driver uninstalled, but i need it. I want it for clipping gaming moments and to modify color saturation to improve visibility. I try to look for solutions online, but most videos are dedicated to Nvidia, they either rely on changing the game’s graphics settings and some settings in window’s as well. Maybe i should try to improve performance through my driver’s settings, but ive tried it before when everything worked well, and theres no reason to believe that it would fix the problems im having now.

I purchased an OEM 5950X last week and ran some overclocks and benchmarks. Currently, I am sitting at 4550 Mhz on both CCD0 and CCD1 at 1.320 Voltage with Dynamic Overclocking at 75 Amps switching frequency. My ram is Overclocked from 3600 c16 to 3800 c16 tightened timings (4 sticks of 16 gb) with FCLK 1900 mhz (1:1:1).

In Cinebench R20, I achieved a Multi Core score of 11,851 and a Single Core score of 633. My max temperatures are approximately 83-90 degrees celsius with a custom fan curve on my NH-D15 starting at 70% at 55 degrees celsius going up to 100% at 65 degrees celsius. 

When I run Cinebench R20 my SVI2 TFN Core voltage drops to around 1.225 V. 

I am wondering if my temperature and performance results are in-line with other users or if my CPU is running too hot. I am wondering if I should re-paste my CPU. I used mostly NT-H1 and had to add a dab of Arctic Silver 5 as I ran out of NT-H1 (I know you should not mix thermal pastes).

Also, if anyone has any suggestions regarding solving Memory Training Failures for the X570 Dark Hero, I'd love to hear your suggestions. My PC has a hard time posting due to Memory Training issues but my system stability while gaming has had no issues at all. 

Thank you kindly for reading in advance!

Anyways!

What kind of temps should I expect while I run Cinebench?

I bought the 011-D Titan 1.2 case with the front distribution plate and recently put it together.

While idle it sits around 30-35 Celsius, when under full load in Cinebench it runs up between 72-79 Celsius. As soon as the process is finished the temps immediately drop back down to idle.

Just curious as to your thoughts. The CPU cooler is ALWAYS cool to the touch no matter if idle or full speed.

1,24,0,1,0,"Figured Out The Source of My New Found Coil WhineHey everyone,

I was lucky enough to snag an RX6800 from AMD direct buy last week. Everything works great except I noticed in most games (especially Valorant, CS GO i.e. games that can push high fps) that my PSU was exhibiting coil whine now, to varying degrees. And it's definitely coming directly from the PSU.  


I was re-installing drivers etc. basically just troubleshooting to see if there was anything I could do about it. I figured it was just the increase in power required for the new GPU (previously had an RX5700) and that I would eventually upgrade the PSU.  


I opened up Valorant and started changing my settings back in the adrenalin software to see if maybe some settings in the software were causing it.. seemed like a long shot. I noticed right away that when it was back at default, there was less coil whine. I thought that was interesting as I didn't have an OC or anything on my card. The next thing I noticed is when I opened the overlay (alt-r), coil whine ramped up but would go away when I closed it. The major culprit happened to be Radeon Instant Replay, however. When I have it on there is coil whine that doesn't ever stop until I close down the game....  


Does anybody know why this is? Is instant replay really drawing more power? Does opening up the overlay really draw enough power to make a PSU exhibit coil whine? Has anyone noticed this or know of any potential solution? I would like to continue to use the instant replay function.. I currently just leave it on but I might have to turn it on and off depending on when I may want to record gameplay because the coil whine bugs me....

1,78,0,1,0,"AMD should add a setting indicating if SAM (Resizable BAR) is enabled or not to the Radeon Control PanelDetermining whether or not SAM (Resizable BAR) is enabled and working is somewhat opaque. The most general method is to open the Device Manager and explore the GPU in question, looking for ""Large Memory Range"" in the GPU's Properties -&gt; Resources section.

However, that does not appear to be sufficient, as my 6900 XT does not include a ""Large Memory Range"" setting, yet the latest version of GPU-Z (2.39.0) indicates that rBAR is Enabled.

After emailing TPU with a bug report and following up with many screenshots and registry excerpts, w1zzard @ TPU (the developer of GPU-Z) is confident that rBAR is, in fact, enabled and working, despite not presenting in the typical fashion.

So, I think it'd be really helpful if the AMD Radeon Control Panel could indicate as such.

I was promised an RTX 3090 for a relatively low price and have been waiting for quite some time (as has everyone else), however as it turned out I was told I shall no longer be receiving said RTX 3090 and by that time prices had gone up considerably - RTX 3090's are priced at around $2800-$4200 in my country IF and WHEN they're even in stock. I have been contacting pretty much every store in my country for the past month ""begging"" for a chance to be able to purchase a GPU, however all of them told me they don't really do queues. I begun to notice people were getting their GPUs through connections and/or special deals, as the first come first serve basis for doing business made it impossible for me and everyone else to have a chance at completing an actual purchase.

**Today I had a chance to purchase a Sapphire Nitro+ Radeon RX 6900 XT SE GPU for roughly $1900, so I decided to go for it! So I guess I'm doing an all AMD build after all :)** 

Hoping I won't be disappointed!

# So, have you guys been enjoying your 6900 XT's so far?

**The long awaited build**:

* **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 9 5900X

1,21,0,1,0,"New UEFI BIOS updates for ASUS AMD motherboards W19 - 3 Motherboards - B550, X570, R1505G&amp;#x200B;



  

**New UEFI BIOS updates** 

**For ASUS AMD and Intel motherboards – W19**

\*Please do not ask about motherboards not listed. Please review the FAQ below for details.  
 

**AMD – B550, X570, R1505G**

&amp;#x200B;

**UEFI BIOS update list noted below – A total of**  3 **boards with a UEFI BIOS update.**

**W19 is in relation to the workweek, these updates were released between the April 30 – May 12th**

&amp;#x200B;

***Why is my motherboard not listed?***

It may have been recently updated. Check  to see if it has been. I post updates on a weekly basis. UEFI’s are released in waves, because of this it can take an entire series weeks or months to see the “same” update if it includes items like CPU firmware. Furthermore, keep in mind that not all updates are applicable to all models. Due to inherent design differences as well as specification and feature variation an update may only be applicable to a specific model.

&amp;#x200B;

***How can I be notified about UEFI updates when they are released?***

If you want to be kept in the loop, you can also follow me for notifications when updates are released/posted. I am also the admin for our PCDIY Facebook Group where I post updates and other ASUS centric product news [

&amp;#x200B;

***How long after a board is produced will UEFI updates be released?***

Keep in mind that generally after a year a motherboard reaches a certain maturity level and as such will see fewer updates. If you feel you have an issue that is dependent on a UEFI release, please submit a support ticket. In some cases, some boards can see updates for more than 24 months+

&amp;#x200B;

***I want to update but am not sure how to update the UEFI ""BIOS""?***

If you want guidance on how to flash/update your UEFI BIOS please watch the video linked below.

[

&amp;#x200B;

***Should I update the UEFI if my system is stable and running without issue?***

If your system is running without issue, especially if overclocked in any way ( including DRAM ) it is advised you stay on the build/release you are on. Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can change the OC experience and require you to retune a previously stable OC value. This does not mean the UEFI is not a functioning release but that changes in the underlying code base need to be accounted for when tuning a system. As many of these values are in low level or specific operating parameters it is best to retune from full UEFI defaults after you have re-run stability test at UEFI defaults.

&amp;#x200B;

***What if the UEFI BIOS listed is a BETA? Should I update?***

BETA UEFI releases are for enthusiasts who want access to the latest features, functions, and microcode enhancements, and overall UEFI improvements. As they are not officially supported, they are not recommended for day-to-day / long-term use. Users who plan to use their system in this capacity and want to ensure the best interoperability/compatibility and stability, as well as performance, should wait for a formal release.  
 

***How long does it take for a formal release to be issued (between BETA and formal)?***

The time span between a BETA and formal release can vary depending on multiple factors including new internal code being provided, validation and qualification as well as other important aspects of UEFI development and validation. Generally, you will see a formal release within 1 to 3 months. In some cases, BETAs are singular releases and will not see a formal release.

***Will a UEFI ""BIOS"" update improve the performance of my system?***

A UEFI update can include CPU microcode as well as other performance tuning enhancements that can influence/increase performance. With this noted it is generally minimal. As always performance analysis/comparisons should be done at stock-to-stock values. This means loading F5 on both releases and comparing your application/benchmark scores. OC-related comparisons may require retuning prior to testing as changes to underlying auto rules can invalidate prior scores even if with similar settings.

***Not every user should update/flash their UEFI BIOS. I stress this again, if you are running without issue(s) you are advised to stay on the release you are running.*** 

***Notes to consider -***

***\* When flashing please perform the update process at full UEFI defaults. Do NOT flash with an overclocked system/profile.***

1.I recommend updating the UEFI BIOS on your motherboard for new PC builds. This helps to ensure the best interoperability, compatibility, and performance. If you are building a PC and have not yet installed the OS, I would recommend you update the UEFI.

2.Keep in mind flashing/updating the UEFI will reset all defined parameters/settings and operating profiles. You will not be able to restore defined values by using a UEFI Profile as profiles are not interoperable between builds. It is advised you note or screenshot (F12) your values prior to flashing if they are complex. Upon completing a flash, I would recommend you load UEFI defaults after the fact and complete a full reboot and shutdown prior to re-entering your prior values. Keep in mind you may need to retune these values under a new UEFI.

3.When you update the UEFI and re-load UEFI defaults depending on your originally defined CSM/UEFI device parameters you may experience BOOT issues. Depending on prior settings you may need to enable or disable CSM to restore BOOT functionality.

4.Be advised that in some cases a rollback to a prior UEFI is not possible. This generally is the case when there is an update that includes CPU microcode (such as an AMD AEGSA or Intel ME). This means you may not be able to “flashback” to a prior release.

5.While not always necessary some UEFI updates may require a clearing of the CMOS. You can either clear the CMOS via the CLR CMOS button if your motherboard has this feature/function or you can also CLR CMOS by removing the onboard CMOS battery for at least a few minutes. You can also attempt to locate the CLR CMOS jumper on the motherboard and short the pins.

6.In some cases, you may not be able to jump from an older UEFI release to a much newer release. You may need to ""step"" update, this will mean upgrading incrementally to a slightly newer build first prior to going to the most recent build/release. In most situations this not required.

I also recommend you backup your system prior to any flash/update and always advise flash/update become executed from a fresh loading (F5) of UEFI defaults.

The board model/name is on the right-hand side and the version number is on the left-hand side. To download the UEFI BIOS please go to

1,18,0,1,0,"What Is The Viability Of BIOS Modding A 5700xt For Gaming?X-Posted From /r/radeon and /r/overclocking. Just looking for any advice or input on this endeavor. 

Just dipping my toes into the idea of BIOS modding, and all the guides for a 5700xt are centered around Ethereum mining. I mine when I'm not gaming, but after this current payout in a day or two, I'm stopping for.

After fixing my [heat issues] I've got a really stable 2150mhz at 1100mv, with memory at 1850mhz. BUT There could be more?

The main mod I see out there for my card is for copying the 1500mhz memory timings to the higher frequencies &amp; a little bit of power limit unlocking.

I understand timing adjustments on system ram, but completely out of my element on Vram. Would I see an appreciable gain in games? Or is there already a bios out there I can flash?

Any advice is welcome to help get a little more juice out of this card. Online resources for this particular card are ONLY for ETH mining, and I don't know if those settings would be effective for games. Like, if you have a computer that is really good for gaming, it will do web browsing and other tasks well. Does the same correlation hold true for mining and games?

Now, my readings, or according to HWInfo, the power reporting deviation 80% under max load. I tested it with cinebench and the deviation did not go over 80%.

1,23,0,1,0,"Are there any programs I should use with AMD?New to AMD, just finished installing the new setup with a Ryzen 5 5600X yesterday night. So far I tried a bit of tweaking with the stock cooler using Ryzen Master and the BIOS (Gigabyte Aorus B550 Elite v2), but I'm buying an AIO cooler next week as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any programs outside of Ryzen Master I should be using to improve overall performance, or any tweaks I should do?

&amp;#x200B;

I was also recommended to do a fresh re-install of Windows 10, which I did not do yet. I believe unless Windows 10 auto updated chipset drivers, I also did not manually download any chipset drivers.

&amp;#x200B;

My current Ryzen Master settings are PPT 89W, TDC 54A and EDC 108A with Boost Override at 125Mhz.

&amp;#x200B;

In Cinebench R23 clocks start at 4.55GHz and slowly go down to 4.4GHz due to rising temperatures up to 85C\~ with an average score of 11405\~

On Single Core I see the CPU constantly keeps switching between the gold star and silver cores, frequencies around 4750-4770Mhz with around 71C \~ degrees and a score of around 1585\~

&amp;#x200B;

It looked like, to me at least, curve optimizer did not agree at all with the silver and gold cores, proving unstable in single core even at negative 5 offset on these two (program crashing with a bug report), while the other cores are atm somewhere between -10 to -15, in multithread test at first I was going -30 on Core 0, -25 on Core 1 etc, I just dialed all of these back to see why the program was crashing exactly, once I set the best 2 cores at 0 curve optimizer it didn't crash anymore.

1,24,0,1,0,"Guidance on moving from Intel to AMD?Hey everyone

I'm contemplating moving from an Intel-powered laptop to an AMD one. 

I'm not very knowledgeable on computer hardware at all. I'm considering this move based on reviews and articles on the performance difference between laptops with Ryzen chips and those with corresponding Intel chips.

I'm not a gamer. The most significant usage of my laptop is in browsers. I normally have multiple browsers (Firefox, Edge, Vivaldi) open with 150-200+ tabs in total. Alongside the hundreds of browser tabs, a music player, the Windows email client and Discord, I occasionally also have VS Code running to do front-end development. Could I expect better performance from a Ryzen laptop for this use case?

Also, should I expect any kind of software incompatibility issues in moving from my current laptop to a Ryzen device? And is there anything else I should prepare for?

Thanks.",guidance moving intel amd hey everyone contemplating moving intel powered laptop amd one knowledgeable computer hardware considering move based review article performance difference laptop ryzen chip corresponding intel chip gamer significant usage laptop browser normally multiple browser firefox edge vivaldi open tab total alongside hundred browser tab music player window email client discord occasionally also v code running front end development could expect better performance ryzen laptop use case also expect kind software incompatibility issue moving current laptop ryzen device anything else prepare thanks

I'm looking to get an LG OLED CX to plug in my computer but I've got a 2070 Super. I spent some days researching how I'd be able to take full advantage of the CX with this video card while I wait to get a new GPU when they become available. Only thing I could find was some adapters that can actually convert DP to HDMI2.1 but are very hit and miss and don't support VRR. So I was very surprised when I was looking into upgrading my CPU+MOBO and found out that some have an HDMI 2.1 + thunderbolt outputs.

I tried researching a bit but couldn't find if it would be possible to use that HDMI 2.1 port to plug into my CX and get 4k@120Hz HDR + VRR, or how does it work. If not, then what's the purpose of this HDMI output?

1,183,0,1,0,"Is Ray Tracing really that much more GPU intensive than anything before it, or is it still a matter of early, unoptimized software implementations in general terms? (drivers, game engine, directx/vulkan libraries etc)Playing Resident Evil Village on 4K with most settings maxxed, fps capped at 60, but Ray Tracing off, a 6800XT stays really really quiet/silent almost all the time. Very rarely, maybe not even 10% of the time, the fans get a bit audible but soon go back to imperceptible levels.

Just by enabling Ray Tracing, the 6800XT's fans get immediately very loud and stay that way during the whole game (no matter the scene).

Does anyone have proper knowledge about whether this is expected to change with software optimizations, on the same hardware? Be it either drivers, game engines, or Windows updates.


-----
On a side note.. Apart from the specific places/scenes widely used to showcase raytracing in this game, honestly I could barely see the differences between Ray Tracing on VS off. And even when I managed to spot the differences, indeed Ray Tracing made some details more ""realistic"" or ""correct"", but not necessarily ""better looking"". For example, in my personal opinion, puddles of water looked better with Ray Tracing off.

So I played the game with Ray Tracing off, and a quiet room.. a much better tradeoff for a horror game imho.",ray tracing really much gpu intensive anything still matter early unoptimized software implementation general term driver game engine directx vulkan library etc playing resident evil village k setting maxxed fps capped ray tracing xt stay really really quiet silent almost time rarely maybe even time fan get bit audible soon go back imperceptible level enabling ray tracing xt fan get immediately loud stay way whole game matter scene anyone proper knowledge whether expected change software optimization hardware either driver game engine window update side note apart specific place scene widely used showcase raytracing game honestly could barely see difference ray tracing v even managed spot difference indeed ray tracing made detail realistic correct necessarily better looking example personal opinion puddle water looked better ray tracing played game ray tracing quiet room much better tradeoff horror game imho

1,48,0,1,0,"5900x first time AMD user - how to make sure temps are ok?After 30 years of Intel, this week finally I switched from my 5 yo i7-6700k to AMD Ryzen 5900x. Big step, I know.

My main objectives is keeping fans very silent. However now I am pretty unsure, I installed it correctly.

I paired it with a  NH-D15 [chromax]( a B550-Xe Motherboard and a pretty noise dampened Thermaltake case with 3x140  NF-A14-HS-PWM chromax.black fans.

I applied paste myself all my life. The old CPU 6700k almost never triggered fans, maybe in some games. But I do not play a lot of games, this being a workstation mainly used for work (after effects, premiere and software development). I did not updated GPU and this is still Asus Strix 1070 and judging from market prices I need to keep it still.

So my configuration is:

AMD Ryzen 5900x  
NH-D15 [chromax]( (both fans mounted) 2x140mm  
Thermaltake case (noise dampened inside)  
3x140  NF-A14-HS-PWM [chromax.black]( case fans

So my problem is, is the CPU temp ok? Have I applied ok the thermal paste? How can I make sure?

At idle, or light browsing CPU load is 2-8%, the CPU Package temp is 55-60 C. But as soon as I do something, temp goes up very fast to close to 80C and maybe even few degrees over. It also go down very fast back to 55-60 C, so there is not much thermal inertia.

AFAIK NH-D15 is very potent and I would expect temps to stay under 70 C even under medium loads. Also CPU temp is 10-15 C at least less than package.

Also I would love not to take out the CPU Heatsink to check how well, I applied thermal paste.

So TLDR, is there a way to make sure the thermal paste is best applied from temperatures?",x first time amd user make sure temp ok year intel week finally switched yo k amd ryzen x big step know main objective keeping fan silent however pretty unsure installed correctly paired nh chromax b xe motherboard pretty noise dampened thermaltake case x nf h pwm chromax black fan applied paste life old cpu k almost never triggered fan maybe game play lot game workstation mainly used work effect premiere software development updated gpu still asus strix judging market price need keep still configuration amd ryzen x nh chromax fan mounted x mm thermaltake case noise dampened inside x nf h pwm chromax black case fan problem cpu temp ok applied ok thermal paste make sure idle light browsing cpu load cpu package temp c soon something temp go fast close c maybe even degree also go fast back c much thermal inertia afaik nh potent expect temp stay c even medium load also cpu temp c least le package also love take cpu heatsink check well applied thermal paste tldr way make sure thermal paste best applied temperature

✅Save files i download from AE to a different  Disk in my PC. (I have my  Win installed on a SSD and i use the WD Black for the downloads)

I wanted to upgrade it for Davinci Resolve and other software, of course I will also game on it but that's on a second place.

  
Currently working on a 12minute 4k project. With the old CPU Resolve was running ok but stuttering when trying to play the 4k h264 clips so of course I was working with proxies.  
Now since I reinstalled Windows, I didn't have the proxies anymore and the 5800x can play the clips relatively in real time at 25fps. That's a big plus.

However when trying to go into Fusion it's the same story as with the 6700k, very laggy.

The biggest disappointment is the temperatures. When the CPU starts going and reaches 100% use, the temps go above 80, the highest was 87. I am using a Noctua NH-U14S in idle it sits at around 42. On the 6700k I was using a Hyper 212 EVO and the CPU was never going above 74.

The next disappointment is the render time. The project I am working on, took around 10:30 minutes to render with the 6700k. With the 5800x it actually takes the same time or closer to 11minutes. I was hoping render time to be cut at least in half compared to a 5 years old CPU.

All in all, I am pretty disappointed, I wasn't expecting the CPU to blow me away but so far I am questioning my upgrade.",upgraded x mixed feeling use davinci resolve might rushed upgrading pretty excited upgrade k x old system k rtx ti gb ram one x ti gb ram wanted upgrade davinci resolve software course also game second place currently working minute k project old cpu resolve running ok stuttering trying play k h clip course working proxy since reinstalled window proxy anymore x play clip relatively real time fps big plus however trying go fusion story k laggy biggest disappointment temperature cpu start going reach use temp go highest using noctua nh u idle sits around k using hyper evo cpu never going next disappointment render time project working took around minute render k x actually take time closer minute hoping render time cut least half compared year old cpu pretty disappointed expecting cpu blow away far questioning upgrade

They both play Insurgency 2. 
Buddy 1 pushes 80-90 FPS. 
Buddy 2 pushes 160-180 FPS. 
Same in-game settings. 
Both have sufficient PSUs per specs.

For the record, Buddy 1 bought all his components on PC Part Picker and put it together himself whereas Buddy 2 bought pre-built from Microcenter. Buddy 1 also experienced similar performance on other games like Warzone and Day-Z

Now, I will be the first to say I am NOT an expert with consumer gaming hardware/systems, but I do have a tech background.   I feel like I’m overlooking a variable or there’s some unintended, indirectly linked behavior. Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated! 

To continue…we’ve spent multiple hours on multiple days running it through the ringer, trying almost everything I can think of: GPU driver updates, GeForce Experience settings, Windows updates, power management plan, firmware updates, BIOS update, re-seating memory chips, and using the EZ Tuning Utility in the BIOS to “safely” tune his system for gaming. 

The crazy part is we used HWinfo and OpenHardwareMonitor to monitor utilization during game, and nothing is maxing out?!

My specific questions for this subreddit:

1. Is a Ryzen 7 2700X capable of keeping up with an RTX 2070 SUPER? 

2. How can we identify if the CPU is bottlenecking performance?

Hi - I have a BSOD problem - the second time in a month it has happened to me without any warning. Well, the BSOD appears only for a moment and immediately resets the computer, during it there is a long buzzing sound. Today I didn't even have time to read the error code, it went so fast.   


The first time the error crashed my computer, there was also this sound and so it buzzed for half a minute, only a hard reset helped.

1,17,0,1,0,"[Rant] Why are the default hotkeys for Radeon Overlay so terrible? (Overlap with a lot of other applications)So I recently had to do a clean install of Radeon Software because the latest driver kept timing out. I'm not sure if that fixed it or not yet, but that's a different story. Anyways, since I did a clean install my settings got reset to the default and it's honestly appalling just how much overlap the default hotkeys have with other applications. 

I'll list a few that I've encountered so far:

- Save Instant Replay: Ctrl + Shift + S - This is ""Save As"" in pretty much every application where you can save something.

- Take Screenshot: Ctrl + Shift + I - This is ""Inspect Element in most web browsers, aside from Chrome where it's Ctrl + Shift + J (Save Instant GIF)

- Push To Talk: Mouse Middle - This is more of a personal one since I use this but I don't know anyone else who uses this, but this toggles Auto-Scrolling.

- Toggle Performance Overlay: Ctrl + Shift + O: This opens the bookmarks manager for most Chromium-based browsers and can also be ""Open File"" for some programs (e.g: qBittorrent has this as ""Add Torrent Link &amp; Adobe Illustrator has this as ""Create Outline)

- Toggle Radeon Chill: F11 - This is fullscreen for a ton of programs.

***

These are global hotkeys, so they should bound to shortcuts that don't overlap with other commonly used applications. I likely unbound all of these when I installed the first time which is why I didn't remember this time around but it was seriously so annoying when I did a clean install and didn't know why some inputs just weren't going through.",rant default hotkeys radeon overlay terrible overlap lot application recently clean install radeon software latest driver kept timing sure fixed yet different story anyways since clean install setting got reset default honestly appalling much overlap default hotkeys application list encountered far save instant replay ctrl shift save pretty much every application save something take screenshot ctrl shift inspect element web browser aside chrome ctrl shift j save instant gif push talk mouse middle personal one since use know anyone else us toggle auto scrolling toggle performance overlay ctrl shift open bookmark manager chromium based browser also open file program e g qbittorrent add torrent link adobe illustrator create outline toggle radeon chill f fullscreen ton program global hotkeys bound shortcut overlap commonly used application likely unbound installed first time remember time around seriously annoying clean install know input going

1,102,0,1,0,"If your GPU is on it's deathbed, undervolt it - a tale of an RX 580 OwnerI have owned a RX 580 for a bit over 2 and a half years, and since then it's board partner design cooler   has caused me nothing but trouble, as the temperatures would easily climb into the high 80's as the cooler ramped up into hyperspeed.

Several solutions have been tried, with fan curve tuning, liquid metal repasting and opening the case to remove a case cooling bottleneck that could exist, but that did not fix the fundamental problem, that the cooler attached to my card was simply not designed to cool it's 150W package.

I like my RX 580 (Would like it even more if I had been able to get one at a reasonable price) but when you boil it down, it is just AMD trying to make use of their polaris stock by putting more juice into them. Not an intrinsically bad idea, but it seems that my cards manufacturers did not really factor this into their design (or lack thereof)

Over the past few months I have somewhat touched upon undervolting, applying a -50-100mv core volage in msi afterburner, this would yield lower power consumption but would sadly lead to crashes, so a few days ago I searched for RX 580 undervolting on the web and got to work. 

And over the course of 3 days I lost ≅ 50W of power from my GPU core, this has led to an 11% drop in performance, but also a 10-15 °C drop in temperatures. 

What managed to keep my gpu stable as I turned down the core clock by 165 mhz and 200 mv was careful lowering of the voltage graph at it's p-state points. I closely followed the stock power graph in my settings, and one test after another I was astonished as the power consumption, voltage, temperature and noise went down without a single crash all the way to -220 mv, where the gpu began behaving somewhat strangely.

You can access these controls in Radeon Wattman, but  lieu of that I used MSI Afterburner, &gt;!since Radeon settings is still (In 2021) barely functional, and did not even launch for me when I tried to check it while writing this post.!&lt; You can access the controls by pressing ctrl+F or clicking the 3 bard left of the core clock slider. (make sure to apply in the main afterburner window after you change it)

I ran over a dozen stable tests but here's the ones I bothered to write down. For fairness I used my cards auto fan profile on all of them, though I use a custom one.

    unigine superposition 1080p medium
    Run 1 - 6544 - 1200 mhz p3 -115mv p4 -160mv p5-7 -180mv - max 72-73 °C
run 2 - 7337 - stock - Max 86 °C
run 3 - 6549 - 1200 mhz p3 -130mv p4 -175mv p5-7 -200mv - max 70 °C
run 4 - 6351 - 1200 mhz p3 -140mv p4 -200mv p5-7 -220mv - max 70 °C

This morning I reverted back to stock settings for a minute and immediately I heard the fans ramp up and the capacitors squealing, I recommend trying to see how much you can lower the voltage without touching the core speed, I just lowered mine just to try to extend the lifespan of my card as much as possible (I want to pass this down to my younger siblings later and I would like for it to last even in a poorly maintained case)

As blistering hot 25 °C heat encroaches Europe, having a space heater on your desk is not the most fun thing, so being able to lower the wattage by a third makes a perceptible difference in being able to be in the room.

1,21,0,1,0,"Why no one is talking about the extremely odd Steam Survey behaviour??Basically all the tech media, especially the more gaming-foucused one, are using Steam Survey to demonstrate the presence of any specific kind of hardware on the market and most importantly is used by Steam itself to point developers towards the hardware most used by gamers (from Steam own words ""The information gathered is incredibly helpful to us as we make decisions about what kinds of technology investments to make and products to offer""). Now as anyone can see that survey is clearly skewed in the month of December and even more in March, specifically toward some kind of Intel quad-core + Nvidia DX12 capable GPU system running a version of Windows prior to Win10. Even more suspicious is the fact that Apple product and VR Headset are uneffected. Oddly enough in that same period milions of Nvidia + Intel laptops where flowing by the pallet into mining farms to compensate for the lack of discrete GPU on the market. So basically that just confirm the suspect that the survey is heavily influenced by a lot of systems that have nothing to do with PC-gaming and unfairly representing Intel and Nvidia product wich is pretty concerning as (again) the largest PC-gaming platform will use those informations to "" make decisions about what kinds of technology investments to make and products to offer"".

1,34,0,1,0,"USB dropout still persistent using a Ryzen 7 Pro 4750G with a MSI B550M Mortar WiFi, Others using similar rigs, Any luck on your end?So, AMD releasing the Agesa [1.2.0.2]( seems to be hit or miss for a lotta people (Sadly a miss on my end)  I noticed when it comes to the USB drop out issues however I legitimately wonder when AMD will address the issue (or know about it still not working for some people) for people using a 4000G APU. I so far tried every known combination of fixes/work around and every bios version that is supported for my APU and none so far seems to fix the issue. I wonder if anyone else with a similar setup has had any luck with this because I am starting to lose faith due to the lack of support it seems, I did contact AMD support previously and submitted a bug report using the tool but only was told to change my PCIe Gen to Gen 3 rather than Gen 4 (Despite my APU not supporting Gen 4 in the first place lol) and to disable C states  (which I did already) and never got a reply past that even tho I explained I tried those fixes and such in the first and reply posts.   


So my question really is if there is still work being done to address the issue in the background of things or if there is just going to be an issue that persists for months or years since I practically am stuck using the USB C port on my GPU with a powered USB hub for everything which is incredibly disappointing for a system I paid a good bit for and the impressions I got going with AMD for the first time since 2012 and the non existent support help being about the same as getting a response from a human on Steam support  


List of things I have tried so far:  
Disabling C-states  
Disabling Spread Spectrum  
Full stock Bios  
Updating the bios  
Trying every other bios version supported by my motherboard  
Messing with VDDP/SOC voltages  
Messing with CPU and IGPU Voltages  
Using Linux  
Underclocking my CPU  
Ram at XMP and Jedec timings  
Disabling Wifi+Bluetooth, Audio, and LAN  
Using different sticks of ram  
Changing IF timings and voltages  
Disabling CSM (never used it since it uses UEFI only by default)  
Disabling XHCI Handoff  
Disabling Legacy USB support  
Setting PCIe Slots to Gen 1/2/3  
Using and not using Chipset drivers  
Changing Power plans  
Disabling windows USB Power Savings  
Swapping PSUs (tried 4 different ones I own)  
Using different GPUs (Tried a 2070 super, 3 Different GTX 970s, HD 6850, HD 7570, and a GT 710)  
Using only the IGPU  
Using a Usb hub  


Also my APU I have checked and it was made in the second week of 2021.

Things I haven't tried is trying to use a different CPU as I do not have the money to be able to get a 5800x let alone a different CPU that supports the motherboard at the current moment, that is the only thing I legitimately have not tried, but apart from that, nothing works so yea. Basically giving up and considering on getting a intel based board and CPU if the issue isn't fixed in the upcoming months and the support I been getting being entirely disappointing at best.

The big reason I am hesitant is knowing that it is already May, and new CPUs are right around the corner that are rumored (aren't they always?) to have large year-over-year improvements thanks to the 5 nm manufacturing process. However, from my understanding, it would be a DDR5 chipset, which would likely require me to buy both a new motherboard and ram, which I imagine will be $$$.

1,22,0,1,0,"I spent a year trying to fix my 5600 XT Pulse via drivers, new PSU, underclocking, better cooling, etc. It was faulty hardware, completely died, and it's too late to RMA.I tried to put all of the relevant information in the title, and I'm feeling so far beyond crushed about the whole situation.

I built a new computer last June/July, thrilled that I had *finally* saved up enough to order a new system that would run games made this decade, manage productivity tasks quickly enough to not make me pull my hair out, and last me another 5-10 years. I also moved, immediately after, to a place where shipping to/from Amazon isn't really viable, and life circumstances left me unable to use the system for about 4 to 5 months.

Almost right from the start, stress tests, games, and even some light browsing would quickly result in a combination of artifacting, freezing, and eventually crashing, all with the sounds still playing.

I started by making sure it wasn't my power supply, and that everything ran faultlessly with my old GPU installed.

So, given the state of AMD's drivers at the time (or at least the prevailing sentiment about them on Reddit), I assumed it was a driver issue. 

With a fully default setting mobo BIOS (and retried with every single update since), I've spent hours upon hours trying every possible driver (as the full Adrenalin installation and as just the driver itself, even before minimal installation was an option in the installer), and every combination of settings. No luck.

I tried setting all fans to maximum, and keeping my room cooler. No luck.

I tried going into Adrenalin advanced performance settings, and - after many hours of researching what I was doing, to ensure no mistakes - I went about underclocking the card, hoping that maybe stressing it as minimally as possible would at least result in it being useable at all. This, combined with maximum fans, kept it working for *some* games, sometimes, if they were set to bare minimum settings. I *still* attributed the rare crash to driver instability, and would go through the multi-hour ""diagnostic"" process, every time.

As of yesterday, the card finally gave up the ghost. A few seconds after booting to desktop, it artifacted, and the display output completely and permanently died.

Delving deep into yet more troubleshooting forums and posts, it seems stupidly obvious - my card was faulty straight off the factory production line. (Something about VRAM?)

Is there anything I can possibly do in my situation? I can't do my work and productivity tasks entirely on my phone, there's no way I'll be able to buy a replacement GPU this year, even at MSRP, and I think I'm completely out of luck on an exchange/RMA.",spent year trying fix xt pulse via driver psu underclocking better cooling etc faulty hardware completely died late rma tried put relevant information title feeling far beyond crushed whole situation built computer last june july thrilled finally saved enough order system run game made decade manage productivity task quickly enough make pull hair last another year also moved immediately place shipping amazon really viable life circumstance left unable use system month almost right start stress test game even light browsing quickly result combination artifacting freezing eventually crashing sound still playing started making sure power supply everything ran faultlessly old gpu installed given state amd driver time least prevailing sentiment reddit assumed driver issue fully default setting mobo bios retried every single update since spent hour upon hour trying every possible driver full adrenalin installation driver even minimal installation option installer every combination setting luck tried setting fan maximum keeping room cooler luck tried going adrenalin advanced performance setting many hour researching ensure mistake went underclocking card hoping maybe stressing minimally possible least result useable combined maximum fan kept working game sometimes set bare minimum setting still attributed rare crash driver instability go multi hour diagnostic process every time yesterday card finally gave ghost second booting desktop artifacted display output completely permanently died delving deep yet troubleshooting forum post seems stupidly obvious card faulty straight factory production line something vram anything possibly situation work productivity task entirely phone way able buy replacement gpu year even msrp think completely luck exchange rma
1,26,0,1,0,"Would a 5800x be worthwhile from a 2700x at 1440p ultrawide (gaming and rendering)?Currently have a 2700x paired with an RTX 2080 and I've been doing more sim racing, FS2020, Squad alongside video rendering in Vegas and Davinci Resolve, and I was wondering if it was a worthwhile idea to upgrade to a 5800x to maybe get some extra performance out of some of these games and rendering speeds.

1,47,0,1,0,"AMD, either do something to fix Relive or remove it from your software.TLDR: Relive has many inconsistencies and they're far from ever being acknowledged. 

&amp;#x200B;

You know those posts you see of ""Day X of me trying to get them to read this post"" or any of those other silly fads? Yeah well, this feels like that.

&amp;#x200B;

I've used Experience, I've used Relive, I've used OBS, I've used all the common recording software one might use but even as a backup, Relive just doesn't need to be in the software.  It's very inconsistent and I'm tired of going through clips to realize it recording a green screen, didn't record, doesn't think it's running, wants to be toggled off and on,  ""can't use certain settings"" (this one was a claimed bug fix to something that wasn't tested and didn't fix anything), of it thinking I'm watching copyright protected content because one of my Netflix windows stayed paused in the background, and now garbled, unwatchable recordings.  The software names everything ""Unknown"" throws it in a new folder it made up. Some of these bugs have persisted through a dead 5700XT to a replacement for anybody that wants to claim hardware.

These bugs have persisted through DDUs, Windows resets, and full blown formats. I don't run garbage in the background... not even RGB software. Yet, I write a full bug report about how I get unusable clips that are nothing but a green screen and audio and your mention in the known issue is ""some thumbnails are green.""  

&amp;#x200B;

So to celebrate my frustration with Radeon software, I'm going to show off a really nice tap Frenzy 4k in Valorant I had. Keep in mind, the only reason Relive had this was because I forgot to run OBS.  Yes, that's my fault to forget to run the software, but I'm not even using Relive primarily.   When I run OBS I don't even allow it to touch the weak AMD encoder because other than the awful quality it has, I'm told by AMD not to use the better h265 option even though that's not the cause of all the issues and I don't want there to be ANY confliction between recording with OBS and AMD.  When I used AMD's encoder with OBS, I've never once had any of the issues I have with Relive.  

*Processing video 3gs7xfqnacy61...*

See AMD? That's not a thumbnail that's green.  It's the entire clip.  I hope this demonstration stresses how bad it is.

In the last 100 or so clips I have, I've counted around 18 green screen recordings where the clips are completely gone and 2 completely corrupted ones.   This post is mostly to vent because this has been having all kinds of issues for months and months and I keep reporting it and there's no acknowledgement.  I'm the target audience that uses your software and I hate it. It feels very untested and I'm sick of losing fun clips because nobody cares to fix it.   

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I don't like being an asshole, I just want this to work consistently or to at the very least acknowledge the problem at hand. I get there is more standard software for a reason but the fact that this can't even be used as a backup feels VERY low effort. I encourage people to use it more to experience these bugs to push them to better their own products and services to at least a standard of working.",amd either something fix relive remove software tldr relive many inconsistency far ever acknowledged x b know post see day x trying get read post silly fad yeah well feel like x b used experience used relive used ob used common recording software one might use even backup relive need software inconsistent tired going clip realize recording green screen record think running want toggled use certain setting one claimed bug fix something tested fix anything thinking watching copyright protected content one netflix window stayed paused background garbled unwatchable recording software name everything unknown throw folder made bug persisted dead xt replacement anybody want claim hardware bug persisted ddus window reset full blown format run garbage background even rgb software yet write full bug report get unusable clip nothing green screen audio mention known issue thumbnail green x b celebrate frustration radeon software going show really nice tap frenzy k valorant keep mind reason relive forgot run ob yes fault forget run software even using relive primarily run ob even allow touch weak amd encoder awful quality told amd use better h option even though cause issue want confliction recording ob amd used amd encoder ob never issue relive processing video g xfqnacy see amd thumbnail green entire clip hope demonstration stress bad last clip counted around green screen recording clip completely gone completely corrupted one post mostly vent kind issue month month keep reporting acknowledgement target audience us software hate feel untested sick losing fun clip nobody care fix x b anyways like asshole want work consistently least acknowledge problem hand get standard software reason fact even used backup feel low effort encourage people use experience bug push better product service least standard working

1,33,0,1,0,"I only started getting the infamous idle / low power random reboots after updating my Windows 10. So I thought I would just add this info here to try and help eliminating this issue.&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: Ryzen 5950x / x570 chipset; with PBO on -16 all cores, +150MHz limit. Radeon 6800XT. Latest AMD chipset drivers, latest Radeon drivers. Never had idle / low power reboots, but started getting them after finally updating Windows (after several months without updating it). I can play a heavy game for hours without a crash, but then a few minutes after exiting it and working on desktop, will sometimes get a reboot.**

\--------------------

I use my PC for work a lot, so usually I completely block Windows Update, and only do it manually once or twice a year. (I try to keep it stable).

Until recently, last time I had updated Windows was several months ago. And for the past several weeks, I was using it without any problems like freezes or reboots.

On my spare time I was playing a lot of Witcher 3 on 4K and never had a single crash or reboot neither during heavy load, nor idle on Windows/desktop or under light load.

Specs are Ryzen 5950x, X570 chipset, 6800XT, PCI-E 4.0 SSD, and 3200MHz RAM (set through XMP or whatever it's called). PBO -16 on all cores, +150MHz max.

Recently I got Resident Evil Village, and after noticing that I could not activate Ray Tracing in the game options, I found out that it was due to not having the latest Windows Updates (and thus, the latest version of DirectX 12). So I unblocked Windows Update, updated the system completely (rebooted a few times and updated again until no more updates were available). (Then I blocked Windows Update once more).

I got random reboots a couple of times on desktop under light load, so I completelly uninstalled and wiped the traces of the AMD chipset drivers and reinstalled all of them at default options. Still get random reboots, especially after playing a game for some time and then exiting to desktop and using it for a couple of minutes. The reboots are always instant, no errors are displayed. The PC just freezes for a second or two then reboots.

Like I said, it only started after I fully updated Windows. But I am not 100% sure if it is related to the CPU or the GPU.

I am aware that the problem is related to hardware, voltage etc. But maybe the way Windows handles internally the hardware/voltage relationship (and maybe the other system components) has changed after the update?",started getting infamous idle low power random reboots updating window thought add info try help eliminating issue x b tldr ryzen x x chipset pbo core mhz limit radeon xt latest amd chipset driver latest radeon driver never idle low power reboots started getting finally updating window several month without updating play heavy game hour without crash minute exiting working desktop sometimes get reboot use work lot usually completely block window update manually twice year try keep stable recently last time updated window several month ago past several week using without problem like freeze reboots spare time playing lot witcher k never single crash reboot neither heavy load idle window desktop light load spec ryzen x x chipset xt pci e ssd mhz ram set xmp whatever called pbo core mhz max recently got resident evil village noticing could activate ray tracing game option found due latest window update thus latest version directx unblocked window update updated system completely rebooted time updated update available blocked window update got random reboots couple time desktop light load completelly uninstalled wiped trace amd chipset driver reinstalled default option still get random reboots especially playing game time exiting desktop using couple minute reboots always instant error displayed freeze second two reboots like said started fully updated window sure related cpu gpu aware problem related hardware voltage etc maybe way window handle internally hardware voltage relationship maybe system component changed update

i have tried different cables. different refresh rates in my monitor settings. i have disabled HDCP. i have disabled adaptive sync, tried with vsync forced on or off. ive tried with freesync enabled and disabled. i have searched extensively online, i have posted numerous times asking for help on this, and still have no clue what the issue is or how to fix it. certainly cant afford new hardware sadly. what drove me to make yet another post was downloading a show in 1080p, which looks fantastic as a still image, but is literally unwatchable when running it is so stuttery. looks worse than a tv from the 90s.

Anyway this will be my first AMD GPU and I'm just wondering if there are any common tips out there regarding things such as the Radeon control panel, etc. I'm only familiar with NVIDIA. Also, apparently Radeon Crimson has both fan tuning and overclocking support, is this true? Currently I use MSI Afterburner to control my fan curve on my GPU. If I could just use AMD's drivers that would be great.

Another random question that I can't seem to find a concrete answer on; will a g-sync monitor work with an AMD GPU? As in, will I be able to enable variable refresh rate somehow?

Interestingly, this BIOS seems to have lost the ability to download BIOS images over the network.  Maybe that feature was a casualty of Asus adding support for Zen-3?

Running Linux so I can't run any of the standard benchmarks typically posted here.  Not sure if Linux frequency-reporting is accurate but so far all-core boost seems to stop at 4.5ghz when running something simulations on all cores.  If only a few threads are used, they seem to boost to a little under 4.9.  I'm guessing that Linux is interpreting the temperature sensors incorrectly because full-load temps seem to peak around 68C (they'd hover between 74C and 78C on my 2700X).  Cooling is via a DR4 Pro HSF.

I'm really curious to see whether the X470-F will now be able to run my memory better than my 2700X could.

AMD Wi-Fi 6E wireless networking module, debuts at AYANEO!!!

------AMD Wi-Fi 6E wireless networking module, debuts at AYANEO with the most powerful network performance------

In the past update, we mentioned that the revised PCBA will use AMD's wireless networking module, many people are saying that AMD didn't launch the wireless networking module, and some even think I'm cheating people. It's like every update in the past, some people are skeptical. I'm very sincere in updating the progress and sharing ideas, there are always people who don't trust me. But it doesn't matter, most of the supporters can see my work, support me and encourage me, which makes the hard work worthwhile.

Today's update officially announces to all that the AMD Wi-Fi 6E module is making its debut on the AYANEO, and we will be using AMD's never-before-announced Wi-Fi 6E wireless network module RZ608 on the second batch of 2,000 AYANEO handhelds backed on Indiegogo, and become the game handheld with the strongest network performance at present.



Many brands are not as advanced as AYANEO, and our cooperation with AMD allows us to be the first to get the latest CPU and technical support among handheld consoles. The RZ608 announced today has never been revealed on the Internet, so many of you don't believe it. We may be the first to use this module on the AYANEO, providing AYANEO users with enhanced performance, both for gameplay and for smooth web surfing.

Wi-Fi 6E is an upgraded version of Wi-Fi 6. Wi-Fi 6E makes 4 main technical improvements compared to Wi-Fi 6:

    Adding 6GHz frequency band to improve network experience; Capacity increase;
    Breakthrough in speed;
    Lower time delay.

Importantly, Wi-Fi 6E is a good solution to the problem of overcrowding in the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, after all, there are more and more wireless devices at home now. If 6GHz is available, devices with high network requirements can connect to this band.

In addition to Wi-Fi 6E, the RZ608 module also supports Bluetooth 5.2 technology, which provides faster connection speed, lower latency, faster transmission speed, longer distance, lower power consumption, and better user experience compared to Bluetooth 5.0, providing you a better experience to connect Bluetooth devices on AYANEO.",amd wi fi e wireless networking module debut ayaneo amd rz wi fi e bluetooth combo module technology amd wi fi e wireless networking module debut ayaneo amd wi fi e wireless networking module debut ayaneo powerful network performance past update mentioned revised pcba use amd wireless networking module many people saying amd launch wireless networking module even think cheating people like every update past people skeptical sincere updating progress sharing idea always people trust matter supporter see work support encourage make hard work worthwhile today update officially announces amd wi fi e module making debut ayaneo using amd never announced wi fi e wireless network module rz second batch ayaneo handhelds backed indiegogo become game handheld strongest network performance present many brand advanced ayaneo cooperation amd allows u first get latest cpu technical support among handheld console rz announced today never revealed internet many believe may first use module ayaneo providing ayaneo user enhanced performance gameplay smooth web surfing wi fi e upgraded version wi fi wi fi e make main technical improvement compared wi fi adding ghz frequency band improve network experience capacity increase breakthrough speed lower time delay importantly wi fi e good solution problem overcrowding ghz ghz band wireless device home ghz available device high network requirement connect band addition wi fi e rz module also support bluetooth technology provides faster connection speed lower latency faster transmission speed longer distance lower power consumption better user experience compared bluetooth providing better experience connect bluetooth device ayaneo

I was trying to get a RTX3080 and did everything possible but couldn't. I just watched prices go up like crazy and in my country Egypt, even lowest models of RTX 3080 are sold for like 32K EGP and OC models for up to 36K EGP ($200 to $2300).

Amazon Japan had a few GPUs that could be ordered but all were Temporary Out Of Stock so I placed orders for them since February. RTX3080, RTX3070, RX6800XT and RX6900XT.

Many orders got cancelled because Amazon couldn't get stock and others are delayed with no due date.

For my surprise, Amazon sent an email saying that the Power Color AMD Radeon RX6900XT Red Devil will be available and due to May 12th delivery.

I decided to pay for it and received it yesterday. Total price with shipping and customs was a bit less than 22K EGP ($1400) so I guess it was a great deal.

For both systems on stock motherboard settings, the Ryzen 5000s would idle at temps between 45-50 degrees and maxing at around 75-80 degrees (one of which being cooled by an AIO cooler). After fooling around with thermal paste, and AIO positioning to no avail I finally found my solution, undervolting. 

I'm not sure if this a an ASUS motherboard issue since both of the Ryzen 5000 builds have been on ROG builds, but I still want to share this regardless. At stock settings, AM4 ASUS motherboards give about 1.45V of power to a CPU socket. This, as of now, causes Ryzen 5000 series chips to significantly overheat. Just by bringing my CPU voltage to 1.25V, my 5800x is currently idling at 28-33 degrees instead of the 45-50 degrees it was before. 

So in the future if you ever find yourself in a position where your CPU is just running way too hot, give undervolting a try! It also cannot harm the CPU since you are in no way damaging it, you are just giving it less power.",huge piece advice ryzen series cpu fellow ryzen owneri built system ryzen cpu noticed thing dramatically reduces temperature system stock motherboard setting ryzen idle temp degree maxing around degree one cooled aio cooler fooling around thermal paste aio positioning avail finally found solution undervolting sure asus motherboard issue since ryzen build rog build still want share regardless stock setting asus motherboards give v power cpu socket cause ryzen series chip significantly overheat bringing cpu voltage v x currently idling degree instead degree future ever find position cpu running way hot give undervolting try also cannot harm cpu since way damaging giving le power

1,43,0,1,0,"HP Omen 30L Ryzen 7 5800x - Undervolting without BIOS optionHi, so I recently bought a HP Omen 30L from Best Buy in a split decision to upgrade from my old system. It was a good deal but i knew certain customizable options would be obsolete. It is a solid build and i do like this pc.

Specs:

HP Omen 30L GT13-1094

Ryzen 7 5800x

RTX 3060 TI FE

32gb Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro(Omen's Hub Turbo'd to 3467MT/s)

120mm CoolerMaster AIO(HP Omen edition)

HP 650w PSU

M.2 1000g

2x 1000g SSD's

I am going to discuss how i performed undervolting, achieving lower CPU temps. 

First, i turned on my pc and installed all the updated drivers. CPU, BIOS, Win10, Nvidia, MSI afterburner, AMD Ryzen Master, Etc. I then had friends playing a game so i jumped in ready for the frames to hit my face like a gust of wind... PC started sounding like a jet engine and i could see CPU temps at 90c. 

Immediately shut off and applied new Thermaltake TG-8 thermal paste.. No difference in temps. 

So I started researching and learned of the 5800x overvoltage issues when all HP gives you is a 120mm Coolermaster AIO. This AIO is not enough cooling and upgrading this is not of interest(time/lazy). I wanted this system to work and i believe i have found the way. 

Default CPU settings would have my voltage at 1.35-1.4 at boost clocks of 4.8ghz. So i started undervolting my system. Not the normal way though as my BIOS is completely locked and has no advanced options to change voltage, curve optimizer, voltage offset, etc. The only way to change voltage or clock speed was by using Omen Gaming Hub and Ryzen Master. 

Using Omen Hub i lowered the voltage with 4.4ghz clock(multicore) until it was instable, running Cinebench R20 a few times with each change. First failure was at 1.075 peak core voltage. 1.08125 has been stable for a multitude of tests inside games, C r20, ryzen master stress test. 

Stats, Cinebench R20 score. Note, can not change fan speeds either so all default settings as well :(.

At default CPU settings in RM = 5614-5627 mc. Single core I did not test as temps were 90c as soon as i started the test in multicore and moved on to undervolting asap. 

At 1.08125v 4400mhz all core = 5727-5780 at 77-78c. 

1.08125v 4400mhz all core Single core = 562, 563 at \~65-66c. 

PBO in Ryzen Master went to 90c immediately with score of 5633 (thermal throttling speed at 4.3ghz).

At 1.15v 4400mhz all core = 5750-5815(only once) avg 5780. but at 80-82c. 

So i think i have found MY solution, 1.08125v all core at 4.4ghz is stable, max 80c, and in games \~72-75c. Idle temps of 52-54c. With 80c seeming to be the degrees where my fans would kick up a few notches and become to audible, i wanted to stay under 80c. Yes my scores are lower than they should but it beats spending $450 for a new Mobo, PSU, and cooler and case. 

I have now bought Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut and Noctua Chromax replacement fans for the pump and rear exhaust. I've also added one old case fan as an intake at the bottom of my case. 

...

Thank you for all who have made posts regarding this CPU and their findings, without your help i would have sent this sucker back. LOL. 

I still feel the itch to get better temps so maybe someday i will cough up the extra coin and custom build another PC with this CPU/GPU. 

...

Questions for Reddit, 

Should i use Ryzen master or Omen software for this manual clock setting?? Using Omen for now. Is there a better option as it kind of an hassle to to reapply my settings each time i turn on my pc. 

At 1.08125v and 4.4ghz i am using EDC 140.6A(74% of 190A) constantly when running Cinebench R20. According to AMD 140A is the max current allowed. Any issues with that?

...

Thank you again. 

TLDR: 1.08125v at 4400mhz gave me comfortable temps and score.",hp omen l ryzen x undervolting without bios optionhi recently bought hp omen l best buy split decision upgrade old system good deal knew certain customizable option obsolete solid build like spec hp omen l gt ryzen x rtx ti fe gb corsair vengeance rgb pro omen hub turbo mt mm coolermaster aio hp omen edition hp w psu g x g ssd going discus performed undervolting achieving lower cpu temp first turned installed updated driver cpu bios win nvidia msi afterburner amd ryzen master etc friend playing game jumped ready frame hit face like gust wind started sounding like jet engine could see cpu temp c immediately shut applied thermaltake tg thermal paste difference temp started researching learned x overvoltage issue hp give mm coolermaster aio aio enough cooling upgrading interest time lazy wanted system work believe found way default cpu setting voltage boost clock ghz started undervolting system normal way though bios completely locked advanced option change voltage curve optimizer voltage offset etc way change voltage clock speed using omen gaming hub ryzen master using omen hub lowered voltage ghz clock multicore instable running cinebench r time change first failure peak core voltage stable multitude test inside game c r ryzen master stress test stats cinebench r score note change fan speed either default setting well default cpu setting rm mc single core test temp c soon started test multicore moved undervolting asap v mhz core c v mhz core single core c pbo ryzen master went c immediately score thermal throttling speed ghz v mhz core avg c think found solution v core ghz stable max c game c idle temp c c seeming degree fan kick notch become audible wanted stay c yes score lower beat spending mobo psu cooler case bought thermal grizzly kryonaut noctua chromax replacement fan pump rear exhaust also added one old case fan intake bottom case thank made post regarding cpu finding without help sent sucker back lol still feel itch get better temp maybe someday cough extra coin custom build another cpu gpu question reddit use ryzen master omen software manual clock setting using omen better option kind hassle reapply setting time turn v ghz using edc constantly running cinebench r according amd max current allowed issue thank tldr v mhz gave comfortable temp score

Read the full write up here \[ This website not allowing to talk against MSI\]

\[URL unfurl=""true""\]

**\[MSI glitch\] - stealth**

[

MSI  have failed undoubtedly failed to refund my laptop amount \[1.40 lakh= 1,911.15 $ \].  They are being so irresponsible on my refund. Instead they are asking me to go to the police station.

As per they asked me to contact Hemachandra\[reddington\] and Dinesh \[Isystems\] - I have contacted several tie and it has not resolved my issue. Hemachandra sent me an email that he has cleared the amount to the dealer and his part is over, Then I again contacted the dealer Dinesh to transfer the money, Dinesh has changed multiple dates and failed to transfer the money,thus MSI. Here I don’t know who is holding the money and why. As per MSI assured me about the refund, it should happen during august 2020, But is delayed for more than 12 months. I have tried contacting the customer care, chat help, emailed to MSI India Service &lt;[indiaservicenb@msi.com](mailto:indiaservicenb@msi.com)\&gt; , everybody seems to incompetent to solve my issue. I don’t understand why i should go to the police complaint as a premium customer, instead MSI company has to file a case who responsible for the delay. I need my refund by this week otherwise i have to go for a legal action which will irreversible. So please resolve this issue as soon possible.

Read the full email details here \[Copy of email I sent to MSI and further replies\]

**This is regarding my MSI stealth GS65 9SE 2019 laptop** \[Serial Number: K1905N0046445\], which I have submitted on 13th September 2019 \[\*Please see the attachments\] towards servicing center at Bangalore \[No,5/18,2ndFloor,OblongBlock,’C’Block,Unity Building, Mission Road, Bangalore - 560 027 \]. I had bought \[1,62,840/-\] the laptop on 7th of September 2019 \[\*Please see the attachments\] and started facing issues on the 9th of September, which is unacceptable. MSI South Indian Marketing Head\] was the only person I could be in touch to know about anything on this. I also tried contacting MSI team through twitter,MSI forum and email \[\*Please see the attachments\] , but the result was nothing. In between Mr.Jathin WhatsApp of me to wait for another week to cross check this case again.

On 17 Oct 2019, Time -13:43 Mr. Monsoor Khan called me and informed that the computer is working fine and hinted me that servicing center is separate a unit from MSI team which makes them to take customer supportive decisions. Even for Monsoor it seemed to be a strange case that in 4 days high-end laptop is giving such a glitch just because it’s lacking a driver.

     Now the situation is that, I have faced this problem on the first week of purchase- which is technically deserves a replacement without any second thought according to the nature of the problem. Instead all of you are saying that this is just a driver issue and it is working 100% and if there any problem comes up after 7 days from the date I take this laptop from service center they will support me \[But Monsoor has not suggested the solution –

Is it a replacement or a hardware replacement \[which is coming under one year warranty\]. In short I am going to lose the chance of replacement for this faulty machine which can go wrong even after 7 days and then I would be continued this again to the service center and also will be searching for this ‘unreachable’ MSI team. This gives a sense that I got a second hand quality laptop which can relapse multiple in the first year of purchase which does not make any sense to me. MSI or Service center not giving any assurance on this, instead they are clearing their side by saying this machine is 100% working or no hardware issue.

Let me add you, I don’t know what kind of test you are running.

Secondly, the software like Premiere Pro CC, Resolume Arena, Touchdesigner and games etc. demands a lot of graphic consistency. Here this laptop is giving glitch on all these including a YouTube video, which is optimized universally for most of the players and computers. The driver report I totally understand and consider this as a good thing, But I am not that stupid as the technicians in the servicing center by thinking and noticing these performance below. :-

The MSI STEALTH was running under temperature 60 degree Celsius \[according to the dragon center application\]. This video the glitch can arise again if the temperature goes high during external display options. It happens only a faulty graphic soldering with in the motherboard. So basically, if it is not purely a driver issue it can relapse again and in this unfortunate situation it can be after that 7 days and I will lose my money and computers.

· \[Apple macbook pro 2011 was notorious for this issue and apple have given an extended replacement program\]

· I have seen videos, which MSI having problems with external display issues and Nahimic sound app issues.

· Who will spend 1,62,840/- for a machine with trouble? Why do I buy a problem?

       I am aware that MSI has sent me a ‘driver’ positive 100% working email, which can be a possibility, but they have not sent me an assurance thing than that 7 days. Here already faded the problem with 4 days, which is not considering at all. So I am really confused and disappointed as a premium customer this makes me thinking further legally or filing consumer court complaint and informing media on this situation. I know it will cause some money and effort for me but it should not happen to any one in the near future by not getting correct response from the company.

I wish MSI TEAM would consider this issue seriously to get a deserving solution than changing the motherboard/component \[this is just a warranty thing\].

Also I am asking for 15 days \[non chargeable\] gap to collect the laptop back if no reply on this letter. This is because I have to arrange my stay and travel and also I have to request a leave from my job to reach MSI Bangalore center.

At this juncture, I would like to inform you that the laptop sold to me was a defective one and the same did not serve the very purpose for which I purchased the same. As per the warranty conditions, terms and policies it is your bounden duty to replace the existing defective laptop with a brand new one or in the alternative to reimburse the entire purchase money entrusted with the second among you and as such you all are legally and morally liable to either replace the same in discharge of your legal obligation or to reimburse the entire purchase money.

As I contacted all among you on several occasions via, phone and email communications, l was not offered with a convincing and cogent reply and further all among you failed to cater my need and only offered deaf ears and nelson's eye to my tenable and legitimate request.

The act and conduct from the part of all among you would clearly amount to breach of the contact between me and all among you, thus violating the terms of the guarantee/ warranty.

That, the aforesaid breach of contract and illegal acts committed by all among you are not in keeping with normal course of business or ethical standards and all among you have miserably failed in ensuring customer satisfaction, proper customer care after sales and customer services by selling a most defective good. Further, the acts and conduct from all among you amounts to unfair trade practices by falsely representing that the laptop aforesaid is of a particular standard, quality, quantity, grade, composition, style or Model and further falsely represents that the after sales services are of a particular standard , quality or grade. Further, I would like to inform all among you that, I purchased the aforesaid laptop by believing the representations, advertisement regarding high quality and standard maintained by the first among you but the subsequent acts by all among you amounts to cheating and fraudulent acts.

I affirm and remind you that, I purchased the aforesaid laptop for my own use and the purpose of earning a livelihood by means of self employment and thus being a consumer I am legally and morally entitled to the benefits as contemplated by the terms of the contract between myself and all among you and have every moral and legal right and authority to defend and uphold my valuable rights as a consumer.

Under these circumstances, I do hereby request all among you to do necessary act and things from your part and to genuinely consider my legitimate request to either replace the defective laptop with a brand new one within 7 days from the date of this notice or to reimburse the entire amount of Rs. 1,62,840/- (Rupees One Lakh sixty two eight hundred and twenty Only) with interest at the rate of 12 percent from the purchase date i.e., (13/09/ 2019) till the reimbursement. Further, that I am in no way responsible to pay any rents/fines for those periods during which the defective laptop was in the possession of third among you. If my legitimate and tenable request is not considered, I shall be constrained to initiate appropriate civil/criminal proceedings and shall also approach the fourth pillar of democracy to intimate them regarding the false representations and unfair trade practices committed by all among you and in that eventually all among you shall be held liable for all the costs and consequences arising thereof, without any further reference which you may please note.

The reddington guy Rajesh said they forwarded to Delhi. I am still waiting for their reply or my refund from MSI.

1,1,0,1,0,"Could AMD integrate separated audio into ReLive clips, instead of having separate files for each? Similar to what OBS does.I love Radeon ReLive for how convenient it is. I also love that it's able to record high quality looking video in small file sizes, compared to OBS. But one thing that bothers me is that the separated mic audio is annoying to deal with. It clutters up the folder with all the clips in it, and makes it a pain to go through everything. Along with that, the audio always seems to be slightly out of sync. Even the file length is a few milliseconds longer than the actual video clip. It's just horrible to deal with, but I prefer having separated audio so I can take my voice out of clips that I upload. But sometimes I clip funny conversations, or other moments that only make sense with context, so it's very annoying to deal with then.

But when separate audio tracks are recorded in OBS, it's all saved on the single video file (somehow? i don't really know how it works). You can play back the video on Windows and hear all the separate audio tracks all at once, but when you drop it in Sony Vegas or Premiere, it separates all the audio tracks that it recorded. Everything is perfectly in sync, and it's convenient for both editing and playback from your folder.

So my question is: Why doesn't AMD do this with ReLive? Is there something stopping them from being able to add this? Are they planning on adding this? If so, do they plan on adding more audio tracks to record on?

This would be the one thing that would make me completely quit using OBS for recording videos and whatnot.

1,260,0,1,0,"RT perf in Metro Exodus EE for RDNA2 is really good, but gimped by HairWorks.A few tech guys on twitter running benches on the new enhanced edition release to test ray tracing perf uncovered something that we used to see in the old days.

Remember when HairWorks would force tessellation factors of 64x for no visual benefit, just to neuter perf on AMD GPUs as they were weaker on tessellation? 

Now its happening but with RT.

Link: 

6800XT
&gt;HairWorks literally destroys performance/frame times in this scene. 



&gt;Looks like a nasty case of a billion triangles on HairWorks + RT triangle intersection overload.

&gt;I suspect HairWorks does not get a simplified geometry model into the BVH acceleration structure like everything else. It retails the full triangle load within the AS, so each ray has to test against an excessive volume of triangles within a small area of a BVH.

Besides these, it appears that 4A Games did a great job optimizing RT performance on RDNA2 GPUs.



GPU profiling for more info:
&gt;It seems like they are basically doing everything right in terms of RT. Occupancy's very good, TONS of async compute, RT is done with Inline-RT (as far as I can tell right now). It's extremely impressive.

I have been saying that RDNA2 would do well with RT when using DXR1.1, with the feature MS added with AMD collaboration on the new consoles, for inline RT (a more optimized method of casting rays &amp; especially for extra bounces or long ray distance).

This is what 4A Games used to ensure RT performs well for the release of the game on these new RDNA2 consoles.

Yet NV sponsored the Metro series and they obviously snuck in their HairWorks that throws a wrench into the RT pipeline.",rt perf metro exodus ee rdna really good gimped hairworks tech guy twitter running bench enhanced edition release test ray tracing perf uncovered something used see old day remember hairworks force tessellation factor x visual benefit neuter perf amd gpus weaker tessellation happening rt link xt hairworks literally destroys performance frame time scene look like nasty case billion triangle hairworks rt triangle intersection overload suspect hairworks get simplified geometry model bvh acceleration structure like everything else retail full triangle load within ray test excessive volume triangle within small area bvh besides appears game great job optimizing rt performance rdna gpus gpu profiling info seems like basically everything right term rt occupancy good ton async compute rt done inline rt far tell right extremely impressive saying rdna well rt using dxr feature m added amd collaboration console inline rt optimized method casting ray especially extra bounce long ray distance game used ensure rt performs well release game rdna console yet nv sponsored metro series obviously snuck hairworks throw wrench rt pipeline

1,54,0,1,0,"I Can't Believe This Worked or; How I Stopped Worrying And Un-""Bricked"" My 5700xtI'm writing this mostly as a log so if anyone runs into the same issues, or has a similar scenario happen, they can follow my story and attempt a repair. 

TL;DR at the bottom.

I have a AsRock 5700xt Phantom Gaming GPU. I was having some suddenly unstable overclocks on the memory. I found a product called K5 Pro, a liquid thermal pad replacement, on Amazon. It looked like a perfect solution. 

I took apart my card, measured the gaps on the memory and VRMs and they all appeared to be under 4mm - in spec for the K5. I slapped a jar all over the memory, and power delivery, plus a couple other set of chip banks that had a thermal pad on it. I got everything buttoned up and installed the GPU back in my PC. . . 

Had a picture of the boot screen, but only for a moment. Then everything when to pure shit. System refused to boot. Clear CMOS. No boot. The system was hanging on the ""VGA"" boot sequence light. 

So I went back downstairs and put on more K5 thinking that was the problem, not enough cooling. Still had the issue. Grabbed an old HD 7850 and confirmed all PCIE slots on my machine still worked. 

It was about 1:30 AM at this point, so I just said ""FUCK IT"", ordered replacement 2mm thick thermal pads, more Kryonaut, and called it a night. 

My thought process was that the K5 trapped some moisture somewhere and was causing a short, or it wasn't providing enough cooling. I have no complaints with the product, as I have it in my Lenovo laptop and it provided marked improved results with temps on the hot spots that had thermal pads.

**WHAT I DID TO CLEAN THE CARD**
The K5 is some thicccc boi shit. Like cake frosting, so taking it off wasn't going to be quick. Found a YouTuber from Australia (Tech YES City) who's entire channel was restoring busted GPUs and motherboards. Followed his cleaning path.

* A can of brake cleaner to spray down the card and get the K5 off. It took the whole can to clean the front and back.

* Soaked the GPU in a tub of 99% IPA, using a cheap toothbrush to scrub off the left behind gunk. Left it in the tub while I was at work, came home and let it dry. My logic was any moisture, or shorts caused by potential moisture, would be removed. I got this idea from This Does Not Computer on one of his retro Apple repairs. Any corrosion or moisture that got under any chips would be whisked away. 

* Used a can of Quick Drying Electrical Contact Cleaner a few times to spray down the card. This is my GO TO electronics repair solution, I find it does a better job than IPA. It's saved a few laptops, motherboards, my DJ Mixer, and my water kettle. It does leave a little residue on the GPU die, so I go back with some IPA and a coffee filter to clean the die and the mounting point on the cooler.

At this point I was confident the card was salvageable. I received my replacement thermal pads (after fighting with USPS for three days because the mail carrier couldn't find the front door to my business, while the other two USPS carriers I see every day could). 

Ran home and did one final spray with Contact Cleaner and began measuring and cutting the thermal pads. More Kryonaut and buttoned it all up. Plugged it in. . . Time for the moment of truth. 

***I GOT A FUCKING SIGNAL***

After a week of dread and anxiety, I had fixed the GPU! I was screaming ""I DID IT! I DID IT!"" - I may have scared the cat. 

I cleared the drivers and installed the 5/6/21 update. HWinfo all seemed to be reporting everything okie dokie. SO, I fired up Forza Horizon 4 to do the benchmark...

***HARD CRASH - SYSTEM SHUTDOWN***

All the wind fell out of my sails instantly. Reboot. Crash again on Forza.

Fired up FurMark and HWinfo to watch how things were going. Instantly ramping up to 88C, and the Junction/Hotspot temp was running up to 110C-114C. I was devastated. Thinking I had it, then more issues arrived. 

Took apart the card and added more Kryonaut, spread it around to the edges. Same temps and issues. I thought my pads must not be on right, so I took everything off and instead of cutting rectangles, measured and cut squares for each component. Slapped everything back together and put it in the system. Same error. 

At this point it was 1:30 AM again and I was dead from the neck up. So sad. Let down by my hubris. I had damaged my 5700xt I got for retail over a year ago, and was facing either no GPU or paying $1,700 for a 6800xt. So pissed.

**THEN I NOTICED**

I was staring at the PCB and realized that the thermal past on the GPU die wasn't even, and hardly any squirted out to the sides. I knew this MEANT something, but I was so brain dead I couldn't get things to click. My Dad was being as empathetic as possible (I live in my Dads hangar keeping an eye on the hangar park, and he stays with me in the summer when he has students - this is important), asking questions and trying to help. I kept mentioning the weird looking thermal paste, and that I couldn't figure out what it meant. Then, I had a last ditch hail marry idea...

**IN COMES GAMERS NEXUS**

I remember seeing some vidz from GamersNexus and JayzTwoCents about the reference 5700xt having mounting pressure issues, and that the Junction/Hotspot for this card was going up to 110C. The solution? A 1mm thick washer under the GPU cooler mounting screws. 

""Dad, do you have any tiny 1mm thick washers?""
'No, I don't think I have anything like that. Nothing that small'
""Are you sure? Plastic, or nylon?""
'No, nothing that small'
""Dad, look at all this shit you refuse to throw away *gestures at hangar* I call bullshit""

So my Dad wanders off and comes back with a tiny set of drawers, like a tacklebox, that looked to be older than me - from mid 80's.

'I might have something in here, but I don't know'

**Wonderous Washer wRoundup**

This mother fucker had stacks of tiny washers, all measured at 1mm thick. I grabbed four brass ones, checked for any SMDs that may interfere with them, and screwed them down. I had never recalled screwing the cooler down this tight before, and I was worried I was gonna shatter the die or snap the PCB. 

I got the back plate back on and triple checked all the screws holding the cooler down. 

My Dad asked
'So, what is this gonna do?'
""It's going to increase the mounting pressure on the die, which may help with cooling""
'Ok, but I don't understand how it's going to work'
""Well, Dad, frankly...I don't either but this guy has over a million subs on youtube, and has a 30 minute video saying that it will work. So fuck it why not""

I went back upstairs and put the card back in the machine. Booted it up and went into FurMark

**68C Stock Settings**

WHAT THE FUCK IT FUCKING WORKED SHIT MY ASS!

We were both dumbfounded. I went from 112C with thermal throttle, to a cool 68C on the Junction/Hotspot, stable clock speed. This was COLDER than I remember running before when I got the card new out of the box. 

I put my normal overclock on the card, and tested it on FurMark. 78C. 

I said ""Fuck it, why not"" and maxed the clock speed out in Adrenalin, undervolted to 1100mv, and went balls to the wall on the memory speed overclock. I have never pushed this card this far before. It would be instant crash. 

**88C Max Overclock; Stable**

Well fucking hell man. I literally cannot believe the state of this thing. 

The GPU was running COOLER and better than before, and it has me completely dumbfounded. I'm excited to throw the whole system back together and play some PC games. It's been to long. 

Hopefully my wild ride was informative or helps someone in the future. I think a combination of new thermal pads of good quality, and proper mounting pressure helped my GPU out.

Thank you for your time.

1,19,0,1,0,"Mod /u/InvincibleBird has been spamming the subreddit with rule breaking posts and refuses to remove them.I don't think I have to explain that MLID has a terrible reputation for leaks and false rumors.  His rumor videos are in direct violation of Rule 6.

&gt;**Rule 6:** No unsubstantiated rumors - rumors or other claims/information not directly from reputable sources must have evidence to support them. Any rumor or claim that is just a statement from an unknown source containing no supporting evidence will be removed.

Apparently that rule doesn't apply to the mod team though, as you can see from the searches below /u/InvincibleBird has been abusing his moderator privileges to post MLID videos.  In fact, most of the posts of their content come from /u/InvincibleBird.  Especially the ones tagged as rumor.





MLID rumor/leak videos break rule 6 by definition.  He is not a reputable source, he frequently has ""leaks"" that are proven to be wrong and does not provide any evidence or sources for the bullshit he makes up.  It's quite apparent from these searches that the general consensus, of this subreddit at least, is that MLID is not reputable.

The moderators need to step up and enforce these rules equitably.  Unsubstantiated rumors, regardless of source, should be removed.  Just because a mod is a fanboy of some youtuber that makes up rumors doesn't mean they should get to break the rules to post their content to the subreddit. If the moderators are going to continue to allow posts like this they need to define reputable in rule 6 to reflect that it means things they like can be posted regardless of their actual reputation.

Here is the most recent example of this that brought the situation to my attention.  You can see /u/InvincibleBird defense of their actions:

1,9,0,1,0,"RIS and Fidelity FX CASOk.. this might be a stupid question, but it's because AMD just won't standardize their nomenclature, so I gotta ask it.

From what I understand, Radeon Image Sharpening (RIS) is actually Fidelity FX CAS.

Now, whether it is or not isn't really the topic of this discussion, but feel free to correct my assumption if it is not.

The real question I have is... If the game I'm running has Fidelity FX CAS built into the engine (Death Stranding), should I have RIS enabled in Adrenaline or not?

 If it is enabled in both the game and in Adrenaline, do the textures get processed through it twice, resulting in a performance hit, or driver timeouts?

If so, is it better to disable it in game and enable it in Adrenaline, or vice versa?

I'm having a maddening time trying to figure out why Death Stranding is giving me constant driver timeouts on my 6700 XT, and I can't pin it down.

I've done DDU cleanup, factory reset install, turned off freesync, turned off Surface format optimization... Can't stop it from crashing.

This game is child's play for this GPU at 1440p. Very frustrating.

Can't find any info on a solution.",ri fidelity fx casok might stupid question amd standardize nomenclature gotta ask understand radeon image sharpening ri actually fidelity fx ca whether really topic discussion feel free correct assumption real question game running fidelity fx ca built engine death stranding ri enabled adrenaline enabled game adrenaline texture get processed twice resulting performance hit driver timeouts better disable game enable adrenaline vice versa maddening time trying figure death stranding giving constant driver timeouts xt pin done ddu cleanup factory reset install turned freesync turned surface format optimization stop crashing game child play gpu p frustrating find info solution

1,28,0,1,0,"r/Amd Megathread Group Member Benchmarks and Impressions of Ryzen 7 5700GAs I had shared with fellow subreddit members earlier, HP has begun selling a Pavilion TP01-2066, a prebuilt system with the Ryzen 7 5700G, for $550 with in-store pickup at Office Depot locations. Since then, many subreddit members outside of myself including /u/blackmachdown and /u/bobloadmire have gotten their hands on this system and have begun harvesting and installing the 5700G in their own systems. I had alluded to doing a review on my own here but now, with so many more people getting access to the 5700G, I believe creating a joint community effort in the form of a megathread is a smarter route to go. As a fellow subredditor, there are two paths you can go down, depending on whether you own a 5700G or you do not.

If you are a subredditor who does *not* have a 5700G, you can do any number of these things:

1. Make a benchmark request anywhere under the reply titled ""Benchmark requests"". Please respond to the post below that says ""Benchmark requests."" Hopefully one or more of us forum members with a 5700G will be able to respond to it and get it tested for you in short order!

2. Ask questions in the AMA thread which begins under the reply titled ""AMA discussion."" This is the place to ask questions about the 5700G when not requesting for benchmarks. I will try my best to organize the topmost post to have an FAQ where common questions are answered.

If you are a subredditor who *does* has a 5700G, you can do any number of these things:

1. Reply to the post titled ""Benchmark results."" This is where you reply with benchmark results in response to benchmark requests. To you fellow members who provide benchmark results, please do your best to qualify your results with the details of your system configuration including your component selection, BIOS settings, and OS configuration.

2. Respond directly to fellow subredditor questions in the AMA thread (see above).

3. Post your own review anywhere under the reply titled ""Subredditor exclusive reviews.""

It did help with junction temps, but it did not help me increase the max boost clock. I was also not able to increase the max boost through more power tool. Maybe I am not using the more power tool mod correctly as others have state that they were able to hit higher clocks, but I do have some good news. Although I was not able to hit a higher max boost the card did have higher actual clock speeds while under max stress loads like occt. I run the card at a max boost of 2450 mhz. When I ran occt on thermal paste and no more power tool I would see a max actual clock of 21 to 2200 mhz. With the mod I am able to hit 2350 mhz with a consistent power usage of 260w. I used thermal right pads on the vram and was able to get 2150mhz with fast timings running. I saw improvements over 2100mhz in time spy and fire strike extreme benchmarks. If anyone else has a different experience please let me know, but from what I have seen using more power tool and getting the card cooler does help with the actual clocks when running high power loads, but light power loads that hit the max boost clock are based on the silicon lottery.",rx liquid metal thermal right pad experiencejust note experience putting liquid metal msi gaming x trio rx help junction temp help increase max boost clock also able increase max boost power tool maybe using power tool mod correctly others state able hit higher clock good news although able hit higher max boost card higher actual clock speed max stress load like occt run card max boost mhz ran occt thermal paste power tool see max actual clock mhz mod able hit mhz consistent power usage w used thermal right pad vram able get mhz fast timing running saw improvement mhz time spy fire strike extreme benchmark anyone else different experience please let know seen using power tool getting card cooler help actual clock running high power load light power load hit max boost clock based silicon lottery

I was thinking of a 5900x, the 5950x would be really better?
The dark hero looks great

Ram level I have not found the compatibility lists, I currently have a gskill trident z f4-3466c16q-32gtzr kit I have no idea if this would be compatible? At least while waiting to get better. I was thinking about this



Finally if I switch to ryzen will I be totally lost in the bios or for the oc?

I would love your advice!

He's been kind of stuck in the past and the only CPU's he ever uses are opterons.

He doesn't believe there has been a real difference in performance over the last 8 years as he himself has never needed more.

I told him that there has been quite significant improvements over the years and he just shrugs it off as ""marketing from people who get hyped over small increases in performance"".

Now I want to prove him wrong, but I kind of can't as I don't own a system from past the year 2012 and can't do any comparable benchmarks as the points system from basically any benchmark out there doesn't show scaling in  the real world.

I told him that a 6 core Ryzen processor (Zen+ and up) would easily beat the 12 and 16 core opterons 63xx he uses, he doesn't believe it and I want to have concrete evidence of the speed improvements to prove my statement.

I can't find any comparisons online of people comparing Opteron to Ryzen and I can't find any video rendering benchmarks to compare results.

1,13,0,1,0,"Is it possible/reasonable for AMD to manufacture big and small chiplets?Let me make it very clear first: The following are just some random thoughts, not a suggestion/leak. I am not familiar with the industry, so there are probably some stupid points, ignoring some important factors. Please feel free to correct me if I am wrong, I hope I can learn something from the discussion. (And this is not relate to the big.LITTLE/Alder Lake-like/heterogeneous architecture.)

Currently there are no 4-core Zen 3 CPU except the OEM-only (at least for now) Ryzen 5300G. Of course one very possible reason is that those Ryzen 5/7/9 CPUs with higher core count are much more profitable. But I also thinks that TSMC's 7nm manufacturing process is quite mature, so the yields are high and there are just not enough chiplets with less thatn 6 cores work. (AMD is probably stocking those chiplets for 4-core Zen 3 CPUs.)

In the future generations of Zen (probably Zen 4), AMD is using more advanced manufacturing process, and my guess is there will be more cores in a chiplet. Otherwise AMD needs to add more chiplets in a CPU to increase core count, which might hurt  performance and increase cost.

Therefore I guess we will see some 12-/16-core chiplets in the future, maybe next year. In that case, since Zen 3 will be an ""old"" architecture, AMD will reuse some Zen 3 chiplets and we will have more 4-core Zen 3 CPUs. And when AMD launch Zen 5, there will be 4-core Zen 4 CPUs.

However, older generation 6-core and 8-core CPUs still have their market, just like the 3600(X) and 3700X/3800X now. If the chiplets have more than 6 cores usable, it'd be a waste to put them into 4-core CPUs.

What I am thinking is, will AMD design two types of chiplets, one big (12/16 cores?) and one small (4/6/8 cores?), small chiplets will have higher yields and AMD doesn't need to waste big chiplets for CPUs with lower core count.

I have no knowledge about the cost of doing this, so I am not sure if producing small chiplets is cost effective. Also there maybe some engineering difficulties to have both big and small chiplets in one CPUs, and not puting them together might affect the flexibility of using small chiplets.",possible reasonable amd manufacture big small chiplets let make clear first following random thought suggestion leak familiar industry probably stupid point ignoring important factor please feel free correct wrong hope learn something discussion relate big little alder lake like heterogeneous architecture currently core zen cpu except oem least ryzen g course one possible reason ryzen cpu higher core count much profitable also think tsmc nm manufacturing process quite mature yield high enough chiplets le thatn core work amd probably stocking chiplets core zen cpu future generation zen probably zen amd using advanced manufacturing process guess core chiplet otherwise amd need add chiplets cpu increase core count might hurt performance increase cost therefore guess see core chiplets future maybe next year case since zen old architecture amd reuse zen chiplets core zen cpu amd launch zen core zen cpu however older generation core core cpu still market like x x x chiplets core usable waste put core cpu thinking amd design two type chiplets one big core one small core small chiplets higher yield amd need waste big chiplets cpu lower core count knowledge cost sure producing small chiplets cost effective also maybe engineering difficulty big small chiplets one cpu puting together might affect flexibility using small chiplets

And I have doubts about the choice of cooler.

At first I thought about taking liquid M22, but people said that cooler would be better. My choice fell on the Noctua U12s, but it is quite expensive in my country ($ 100) 

Then I found used BeQuiet Dark Rock 4 (non pro) for 50 $ still under warranty.  I think maybe it would be a good deal. 

Will this cooler be enough for 3900x?

I have a AMD 6900xt GPU, AMD R9 5900x, Gigabyte Aorus Master Motherboard. For a little background the issue that I am about to describe does not happen until I download the most recent drivers for my GPU. If I have a fresh install of windows the monitor does not have an issue. 

What is happening is my monitor a Gigabyte AORUS FI27Q, is not properly getting identified and is being defaulted to a resolution of 640 x 400p. When I look in AMD Radeon Software The monitor is given a default name and not recognized for what it is. No matter what I have tried I can not do anything or get the monitor to properly be identified or get the proper resolution. I tried different wires, different ports, and I tried different port types as well. The issue only happens with this specific monitor when I use the display port.  I have a secondary monitor that uses a display port and has no issue. 

Like I stated above, This issue only appears after I download the most recent AMD drivers. When I was running on the driver version that was two or so iterations behind, I apologize I am not sure the specific driver name, since I cant find it anymore on AMDs site, I did not have this issue. 

Hopefully someone can help me, as I have not faced an issue like this before and it is a little confusing. Thank you all in advance, and if no one know I completely understand!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking to upgrade my CPU and Motherboard for my almost 10 year old pre-built gaming/art PC (2012).

I'm new/inexperienced in sorting through CPUs, especially Ryzen's, so I'm not exactly sure what a solid upgrade option would be. From what I've researched, my i5-3570k is still a good processor for gaming, (which I don't quite understand how a 9-10 year CPU still is), but that's what is making picking out a Ryzen chip even more confusing.

I understand a GPU upgrade would probably benefit my system more than a CPU/Motherboard upgrade, but with the state and prices of GPUs currently, I plan on waiting to upgrade that when prices come down.

I plan on looking for good used CPUs, rather than buying new at 250-300+, so I'm hoping to get some advice on what chips to look out for and snag when I see it at a low price.

1,18,0,1,0,"X570 ITX board supporting ECC?I’m hoping to get my 2x32GB KSM32ED8/32ME running with my 5950X. Currently it’s running in a B550I Aorus Pro AX. This was always supposed to be a temporary setup. The main reason to change the board is that I would like to be able to experiment with ECC memory overclocking. On this B550I it only seems to run this memory stable at stock settings. The other main thing is PCIe 4.0 x4 for the secondary M.2, but honestly at this point I think I prefer B550 over X570.

I was under the impression that ASUS would have the best ECC compatibility, perhaps they still do, but the Strix X570-I that I tested last night (which took 3 months to get my hands on!) refuses to POST (yellow memory LED stays lit) with any of the three kinds of ECC UDIMM memory I have on hand: 

32GB Kingston KSM32ED8/32ME modules
16GB Samsung M391A2K43BB1-CRC modules
8GB Super Talent F24EA8GS modules

The BIOS versions tested so far:

- 3001
- 3801

This was unexpected and highly frustrating. I guess I was setting my expectations too high. I’m still willing to continue to test different boards with this 3600X I have on hand until I find the right board to complete this holy grail mini workstation with... I’m not going to tear down the workstation only to have it refuse to post again though, never again. If it turns out impossible to make the dream work I might need to just drop the 5950X into the Dark Hero I have here and give up on ITX, but that would be very sad!

Just wondering if there are any tips or tricks anyone’s got. Maybe there’s some secret way to trick a board into booting up with ECC when it doesn’t seem to want to do it?

I know I can more exhaustively test the rest of the available BIOSes, I just think that because none of these ECC modules worked, maybe they’re simply not including the code for ECC on this particular ITX board...",x itx board supporting ecc hoping get x gb ksm ed running x currently running b aorus pro ax always supposed temporary setup main reason change board like able experiment ecc memory overclocking b seems run memory stable stock setting main thing pcie x secondary honestly point think prefer b x impression asus best ecc compatibility perhaps still strix x tested last night took month get hand refuse post yellow memory led stay lit three kind ecc udimm memory hand gb kingston ksm ed module gb samsung k bb crc module gb super talent f ea g module bios version tested far unexpected highly frustrating guess setting expectation high still willing continue test different board x hand find right board complete holy grail mini workstation going tear workstation refuse post though never turn impossible make dream work might need drop x dark hero give itx sad wondering tip trick anyone got maybe secret way trick board booting ecc seem want know exhaustively test rest available bioses think none ecc module worked maybe simply including code ecc particular itx board

Go into settings on msi afterburner, turn on ""enable unified gpu usage monitoring"". That's it. And just like that, problems disappeared. Everything is stable, no more lag spikes.

1,49,0,1,0,"Water Cooled R7 5800X Running HotHi!

I replaced my old Sandy Bridge-E system this week with a system based around a 5800X. It is much faster obviously, but it is also running hot. Like, *really* hot.

Running Cinebench R20, the temperature jumped up to 90 C and stayed there. I tried remounting the CPU block (cleaning and applying new thermal paste as well), which made no noticeable difference to me. I've tried enabling PBO(2?) and set an all core undervolt of 5, which reduced my max temps to around 85 C. One thing I've noticed in general is that the temperatures seem to jump around much quicker than what I've seen on my old processors. [This is how quickly the temperature jumps to 85 C, when running R20 with -5 undervolt.](

I'm using the same custom loop as I had on my previous system: a Heatkiller IV CPU block, one 280mm radiator in push configuration, and a D5 pump. The only addition is a block for the south bridge, which seems to have a TDP of 11W from what I've read.
This loop could cool my old E5 1650 running at 4.7GHz @ 1.4V, which was pulling over 200W if the sensor readings of that motherboard were accurate.

I did some digging yesterday and found that this processor seems to be running pretty hot, but I'd also like to think that my loop should be able to handle this processor...

TL;DR: My 5800X reaches 90 C immediately under heavy load, with stock settings, despite being water cooled (280mm radiator).

1,60,0,1,0,"Why are Nvidia gpus selling for more than AMD gpus on a price-change basis?Hey peeps, early morning for me, can't seem to fall asleep. I'm not sure where to post my thoughts, so I'm gonna post them here.

I've been seeing 3070s being resold in the 1200-1400 side. I've also seen 6900xt reference gpus being sold for 1400s, 1500s,2000s. I'm stumped on why this is and want to know why. 

Mathematically speaking, buying a 6900xt is cheaper given the massive price increases. 

Let's say I bought one for 1600.(1600 (current)-1000(MSRP))/1000(MSRP)x100= 60% increase from MSRP.

Let's says I buy a non-reference 3070 for 1300, and an estimate in MSRP is uuuh let's say like $580. (1300-580)/580x100= 124% increase in price.

So there's like a 2x increase between a 6900xt and 3070. Financially speaking, when the market stabilizes and more graphics cards are produced, cards will be offered at prices closer to MSRP; in other words, the higher the price percentage increase the more you will lose if you decide to sell during the price adjustment period. 


Someone please give insight into this and why Nvidia cards are selling for so much more than MSRP compared to AMD. Or at least prove me wrong or correct me, I'm always down to learn :)

1,8,0,1,0,"AMD RMA Ryzen 5600x Malaysia (CPU bought overseas), how long? can I RMA overseas?Hello, so I bought a 5600x a couple months back when I was in Australia, I have since moved back to Malaysia. On research back then it was very difficult to source parts in Malaysia, it was also cheaper to buy in Australia. So I sat on the CPU for a couple months because of life, unsure when I'll get a flight, GPU unavailability etc etc.

I installed my PC and was experiencing a lot of BSOD errors. I did everything I could to find out the problem until I caved and brought it into a store. They replaced my CPU with a 3600x and said the problem stopped. I contacted AMD for an RMA on Thursday and have not gotten a response. I tried calling the Malaysian AMD customer service but the number was not in service. I sent another email on Monday.

I have a ""gaming event"" I'd really like to take part in happening in 2 weeks, what are the odds I can get my CPU replaced by then? is it possible to get an RMA if I bought it overseas?

1,57,0,1,0,"Buy a Ryzen CPU directly from AMD, FedEx loses package?I'm certain others have run into this.
Snagged a 5900x for a new build for my wife. Got purchase confirmation, card charge confirmation and shipping confirmation with FedEx tracking on Thursday. FedEx tracking showed that it got picked up from Saint Paul MN on Friday with a delivery date of Monday May 3rd.

I checked it Sunday night and noticed that the last update showed it arriving at the Osseo MN facility at 12:10am Saturday morning, but it still showed a delivery date of May 3rd by end of day. Package never shows on Monday so I check the FedEx tracking, the last update was it arriving in Osseo MN Saturday morning, and now the scheduled delivery date was showing as ""pending"". Clearly, my CPU is lost somewhere or was taken.

I go to contact AMD and after 30 minutes of searching, couldn't find any number to call for online order issues, and no customer support chat or ticket form I can fill out, almost as if the only interaction they have for a customer buying direct is the purchase process, and even that requires no human interaction.

I called FedEx and they said they can't do anything unless it still hasn't updated by Wednesday, and even then, they can only start their internal location / investigation. The FedEx guy also mentioned that if they can't find it, I'll need to reach out to AMD to ship another, and AMD will go through their standard insurance claim process to request FedEx to reimburse AMD for the lost product. How does any of this work if AMD offers no way to contact them regarding online order issues? Or, am I just blind abd I missed the process for ""what to do when FedEx loses the very hard to obtain shit that you purchased from us""?

Anyone else have to deal with this? Any tips or advice?

Semi-recently bungie fixed this issue with NVIDIA GPUs however AMD remains unsolved with several non-fixes which have mitigated the issues for some at least including editing the CVARS, toggling VSYNC, clearing shader cache, etc..

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to post here to convey my own success with fixing this issue for myself, as well as potentially get some feedback on whether anyone else has had success with this solution.

**The Change:**

This does not solve the problem by any means but I noticed significant improvements.

TLDR: Use PCIE 4.0 if you aren't already

&amp;#x200B;

I recently just rebuilt my computer to have a vertical mount and ran into this same FPS issue everyone else had. I had previously wondered why I wasn't experiencing severe FPS drops until after I bought a new PCIE 3.0 vertical mount for my 6800XT. 

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as I booted up my computer after installing this new mount, I was getting horrible FPS in D2. I thought this was fishy, so I ordered a PCIE 4.0 x16 riser cable to replace it and voila!  No more studdering, solid FPS even on the tangled shore.

&amp;#x200B;

I was pretty skeptical this would fix it so i tried it a couple more times. Swapped back to the 3.0 riser and got 13fps in tangled shore. Swapped to 4.0 and getting 60+.

I can get this 4650g with a cooler and 3y warranty. Or I can also get 4750g for ~298€ / ~ 357$.
Or is something on the Intel size also worth considering ?

1,48,0,1,0,"Future GPU ""street"" prices - 2022 and onwardsWith all events happening in the last couple of years and no releases in the very upcoming future, I think it would be fun to discuss about the future prices of graphics cards, assuming the market somehow stabilizes in the not too distant future (perhaps one year from now), since COVID should be over and mining could potentially crash again - albeit no one knows for sure, obviously.

IMO, **once this settles**, we might have to pay the next prices for the GPU tiers:

* Entry-level (RX 6500 XT/3050 Ti) - 250$
* Lower-end midrange (RX 6600 XT) - 350$
* Upper midrange (RX 6700/RTX 3060) - 500$
* Lower high-end (RTX 3070) - 750$
* Upper high-end (RTX 3080) - 1000$
* Lower enthusiast (RTX 3080 Ti) - 1500$
* Uber enthusiast (RTX 3090) - 2000$

The reasons for that being:

* In 2019, midrange cards were already 400$ (RX 5700 XT), high-end 700$ (RTX 2080S) and enthusiast 1200/1500$ (2080 Ti/3090).
* A lot of money has been printed in the last year, which will lead to some inflation - how big that is no one knows as of yet.
* GPUs are becoming more ""multi purposeful"" almost every day.
* Some people might gamble on the crypto-bubble thinking that their cards will be resold for at least the same amount of money 2-3 years later when a new bubble bursts - it's obviously a gamble, but after so many bubbles happening, I assume more people will do it.
* Many gamers didn't upgrade from their older cards until know.
* Tariffs -&gt; in theory it might only affect USA, but I'm pretty sure the folks in Europe, for instance, will just ""adapt"" the new MSRP as well, because why not?
* Corporations want higher margins every time.
* Newer node processes/memory technologies are not getting any cheaper, in fact, on the contrary.
* Scalpers, scalpers, scalpers

Now, what do you think? :)

Whenever I am playing games, the GPU Usage just always seems to be spiking up and down. I watched other people's benchmark videos of them playing like GTA V, CS:GO, DayZ with the same exact parts as me, same settings, and same graphics quality, and they always have their GPU Uitilasied to 90%-100% and it stays there, it's stable. For me, it always seems to be dropping and rising up and just doesn't seem to wanna stabilize. CPU is always between 50%-80% and therefore makes me think that it may be a bottleneck but I don't how, I've seen people saying that this GPU and CPU are a great combo. I just don't know what to do anymore.

Solutions I've heard might work and tried:

•	DDU Uninstaller.

•	Switch from Balanced to High Performance in Power Options.

•	Enabling Unified GPU Usage Monitoring in MSI Afterburner.

•	Lowering and Increasing Graphics Quality settings in Games

None of these worked.

I haven't played around with anything else, heard that going into BIOS and changing something might work but I haven't heard much more about that.

I do have my GPU Undervolted, not sure if it is because of that.

Therefore if you guys have any tips or suggestions that may fix this it would be gladly appreciated, I am more than happy to take any more screenshots if needed.

1,46,0,1,0,"I built an AI transcoding benchmark to stretch even the Threadripper Pro 3995WX.So, about 15 months ago, I started working on a project to improve the quality of TV shows like Deep Space Nine, Stargate SG-1, and other mid-1990s sci-fi that's been effectively abandoned. I decided to take that work and use the concept as the basis for a transcoding and remastering benchmark that would step through the process of starting with old, interlaced SD footage, and end with the recompilation of the upscaled frames back into a watchable video. 

This is a workflow that can stretch even the Threadripper Pro 3995WX -- but it also showcases just how much horsepower AMD currently brings to the table in these systems. I intend to use the test in reviews going forward, so this is not a one-time effort. I built this benchmark specifically to scale on high-core count systems so that I could test Threadripper transcoding in a real-world (if high-end) workload that would be more applicable than just running multiple instances of Handbrake. 

[

It's currently in 0.1, but I'll be updating the application versions and releasing the actual code I run in the future, once I've tuned it a bit more. Topaz Video Enhance AI is a paid application with a trial period, but the other applications that I use are open source and can be run by anyone. 

The Threadripper 3995WX is an absolute beast of a transcoder. It leaves even the 3990X in the dust in the transcoding section of the workload. The AI upscaling (mostly GPU-based) and FFmpeg recompilation sections show different performance patterns, though, which illustrates where the 3995WX can and can't improve performance in this kind of application.",built ai transcoding benchmark stretch even threadripper pro wx month ago started working project improve quality tv show like deep space nine stargate sg mid sci fi effectively abandoned decided take work use concept basis transcoding remastering benchmark step process starting old interlaced sd footage end recompilation upscaled frame back watchable video workflow stretch even threadripper pro wx also showcase much horsepower amd currently brings table system intend use test review going forward one time effort built benchmark specifically scale high core count system could test threadripper transcoding real world high end workload applicable running multiple instance handbrake currently updating application version releasing actual code run future tuned bit topaz video enhance ai paid application trial period application use open source run anyone threadripper wx absolute beast transcoder leaf even x dust transcoding section workload ai upscaling mostly gpu based ffmpeg recompilation section show different performance pattern though illustrates wx improve performance kind application

I  have recently bought a 5900x and for obvious reasons I don't have a GPU. I am using my old GTX 970 to play Dota 2 and other not very demanding games. Since I don't need that much of a power from my CPU I want to underclock/undervolt it. Also my 5 year old Corsair H80i Gt is too loud for me when the CPU is at full load (yes I'm going to replace it with something better soon). I have played around the OC setting at Ryzen Master (under full load the temp is 60C)

Now yes the 4GHz is enough for me but I am no expert at messing with OC settings, 

I wonder does the voltage looks good for you guys?

Is there supposed to be a ratio between the clock speed and the voltage even if the system doesn't fail and restart to default settings? 

Will it in any way damage my CPU if the voltage is low and the clock speed is high? (like my settings)

I guess you guys understood what I meant.

Once it was reset, I figured I would see about running the FCLK @ 2000, with my ram at 4000--it actually worked. Booted it up, did cinebench multi and single core for just a few minutes to make sure it wouldn't crash. I don't have official scores to post, but mine have been terrible compared to other 5900x, and I would guess it is from terrible ram.

I play on 1080P 144Hz. 

While the 3600 is sufficient for my GTX 1060, I plan on upgrading to an RTX 3060 TI once prices stabilize somewhat and the 3600 simply bottlenecks the 3060Ti in most CPU intensive games, Warzone especially (115 vs 150+ FPS), which would feel like throwing money out of the window when I won't be getting the full benefit of this powerful GPU. BF5 already gets bottlenecked by the 3600.

I have seen good deals on the 3700X and 3800X, but the new 5600X is available for almost the same price as those two.

What would be the better upgrade for this situation? 3700x BC of the 2+ cores or a 5600X with the same number of cores I already have?

Pretty top end rig six years ago (ok, went from 780 Ti to 1080 Ti about four years ago)

Since I can't get a new GPU any time soon (aiming for 3080), I considered upgrading the rest of my components and going with a Ryzen 7 5800x, 2x8GB DDR4 3200MHz (probably add 2x8GB more later) on an X570 motherboard. That way I'll be ""up to snuff"" if/when I can actually get my hands on a new GPU.

The most stressful things I use my PC for is mainly gaming, although not as much as I used to. I do play the latest single player open world RPG/action type games like Cyberpunk. Plus I do some general video and photo editing and video encoding.

Although if a RTX 3080 were to fall in my lap tomorrow I would probably wait a year or more before upgrading the rest of my system, waiting on Zen 4, DDR5, etc.

The improvements seem pretty substantial on paper, but not sure if updating to 5800x will garner any significant performance gains for what I use it for.

First of all i found out that while im playing Forza Horizon 4 my PC is using 97% GPU when the game is on max settings also my fps is always aroud 100 which should not be the case with my components. The other things is when i for example try to lower my settings in Forza from Maximum to for example ultra my GPU usage drops to 70-80% and it remains like that, however even if i lowered my settings im getting the same FPS again, i tried lowerdig to a High or Medium and it's similar usage drops to 50-60% and my FPS is way worse. Why is this happening? Isn't it supossed to give 90%+ gpu usage no matter what settings are set in the game. My pc is acting like it saving energy, power or something like. The reason why this problem i bothering me is that i have 144hz monitor and i want 100% perfromance that i can get in games so i can put that 144hz to some use. All the drivers in my pc are updated and also this problem started before i updated the drivers and it still remained after updating so i don't think that a problem is related to drivers.

I recently switched over from an RTX 3080 and was previously running a triple monitor setup, but ever since switching a couple weeks ago I've been running dual monitor as my TV hasn't been detected. I thought it was an issue with the HDMI port on my GPU so I bought an HDMI-DP adapter, but the problem is still persisting. What's interesting is that I unplugged the HDMI cable from my TV's side and my screens started flickering, so it appears as though the TV *is* giving off a signal, it's just not being detected by the GPU.  


Anyone have any ideas as to what is going on? I am on the latest drivers.  


Specs if needed:  
i7 9700k  
Aorus Pro Wifi z390  
32GB 3200Mhz DDR4  


Thanks",xt detect tv hi msi gaming x trio xt detect tv whatever reason recently switched rtx previously running triple monitor setup ever since switching couple week ago running dual monitor tv detected thought issue hdmi port gpu bought hdmi dp adapter problem still persisting interesting unplugged hdmi cable tv side screen started flickering appears though tv giving signal detected gpu anyone idea going latest driver spec needed k aorus pro wifi z gb mhz ddr thanks

Addition source: [

Scientific paper: [

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Researchers from two universities have discovered several new variants of Spectre exploits that affect all modern processors from AMD and Intel with micro-op caches. Existing Spectre mitigations do not protect the CPUs against potential attacks that use these vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, researchers believe that mitigating these vulnerabilities will cause more significant performance penalties than the fixes for previous types of Spectre exploits. However, it remains unknown how easy these vulnerabilities are to exploit in the real world, so the danger may be limited to directed attacks.   
&gt;  
&gt;Three New Types of Potential Spectre Attacks  
&gt;  
&gt;Scholars from the University of Virginia and University of California San Diego have [published]( a [paper describing three new types of potential Spectre attacks]( using vulnerabilities of micro-op caches (thanks [Phoronix]( for the tip). The team of researchers led by Ashish Venkat discovered that hackers can potentially steal data when a CPU fetches commands from the micro-op cache. Since all modern processors from AMD (since 2017) and Intel (since 2011) use micro-op caches, all of them are prone to a hypothetical attack.   
&gt;  
&gt;The document lists three new types of potential attacks:   
&gt;  
&gt;A same thread cross-domain attack that leaks secrets across the user- kernel boundary;  
&gt;  
&gt;A cross-SMT thread attack that transmits secrets across two SMT threads running on the same physical core, but different logical cores, via the micro-op cache;  
&gt;  
&gt;Transient execution attacks that have the ability to leak an unauthorized secret accessed along a misspeculated path, even before the transient instruction is dispatched to execution.  
&gt;  
&gt;Fixes Going to Hurt  
&gt;  
&gt;Both AMD and Intel had been informed about the vulnerabilities in advance, but so far, no microcode updates or OS patches have been released. In fact, the researchers believe that since potential attacks must use mitigations in extremely low-level caches, it will be impossible to fix the weaknesses without severe performance impacts.   
&gt;  
&gt;The document describes several ways to mitigate the vulnerabilities.    
&gt;  
&gt;One of the ways is to flush the micro-op cache at domain crossings, but since modern CPUs need to flush the Instruction Translation Lookaside Buffer (iTLB) to flush the micro-op cache, frequent flushing of both will 'lead to heavy performance consequences, as the processor can make no forward progress until the iTLB refills.'   
&gt;  
&gt;The second way is to partition micro-op caches based on privileges. However, as the number of protection domains increase, such partitioning would translate into heavy underutilization of the micro-op cache, removing much of its performance advantages.   
&gt;  
&gt;Yet another way is to implement a performance counter-based monitoring that detects anomalies, but the technique is prone to misclassification errors, whereas frequent probing leads to significant performance degradation.   
&gt;  
&gt;Low Risk?  
&gt;  
&gt;One thing to keep in mind is that exploiting micro-ops cache vulnerabilities is extremely tricky as such malware will have to bypass all other software and hardware security measures that modern systems have and then execute a very specific type of attack that is unconventional, to say the least. To that end, chances that the new Spectre vulnerabilities will lead to widespread wrongdoings are rather low. Instead, they could be used for specific targeted attacks from sophisticated players, like nation-states",researcher two university discovered several variant spectre exploit affect modern processor amd intel micro op cachessource addition source scientific paper x b researcher two university discovered several variant spectre exploit affect modern processor amd intel micro op cache existing spectre mitigation protect cpu potential attack use vulnerability meanwhile researcher believe mitigating vulnerability cause significant performance penalty fix previous type spectre exploit however remains unknown easy vulnerability exploit real world danger may limited directed attack three type potential spectre attack scholar university virginia university california san diego published paper describing three type potential spectre attack using vulnerability micro op cache thanks phoronix tip team researcher led ashish venkat discovered hacker potentially steal data cpu fetch command micro op cache since modern processor amd since intel since use micro op cache prone hypothetical attack document list three type potential attack thread cross domain attack leak secret across user kernel boundary cross smt thread attack transmits secret across two smt thread running physical core different logical core via micro op cache transient execution attack ability leak unauthorized secret accessed along misspeculated path even transient instruction dispatched execution fix going hurt amd intel informed vulnerability advance far microcode update o patch released fact researcher believe since potential attack must use mitigation extremely low level cache impossible fix weakness without severe performance impact document describes several way mitigate vulnerability one way flush micro op cache domain crossing since modern cpu need flush instruction translation lookaside buffer itlb flush micro op cache frequent flushing lead heavy performance consequence processor make forward progress itlb refill second way partition micro op cache based privilege however number protection domain increase partitioning translate heavy underutilization micro op cache removing much performance advantage yet another way implement performance counter based monitoring detects anomaly technique prone misclassification error whereas frequent probing lead significant performance degradation low risk one thing keep mind exploiting micro ops cache vulnerability extremely tricky malware bypass software hardware security measure modern system execute specific type attack unconventional say least end chance spectre vulnerability lead widespread wrongdoing rather low instead could used specific targeted attack sophisticated player like nation state

I managed to snag a Asus ROG STRIX Gaming RX 6700XT for $900+5% tax (canuckeroos) and now I'm curious if I should keep it and sell my MSI RTX 2080ti Ventus OC edition.  


Looking at benchmarks, they are very similar in rendering performance, while the RTX 2080ti has the edge in ray tracing. I'm driving an ASUS MG279Q monitor (freesync), so I'd love to use an AMD card again that works with it. I haven't managed to get the RTX 2080ti to play nice with freesync on this monitor unfortunately.

1,106,0,1,0,"Rumor: AMD no longer launching Zen 3+ or any refreshed Ryzen CPUs in 2021[

&gt;According to recent rumors, AMD may have canceled its Ryzen Zen 3+ lineup (codenamed Warhol) which was expected to release in Q4 2021. The Warhol lineup of CPUs (Ryzen 6000 Series) was planned to be a refresh of Zen 3, however, there may have been a sudden change of plans. This news comes from PC hardware-focused YouTuber [RedGamingTech,]( who claims that several internal sources have provided him with this information.  
&gt;  
&gt;A couple of sources, which have been reliable in the past, suggest that Warhol has been removed from AMD’s internal roadmap. Additionally, there has been barely any mention of Warhol as of late, leading to the belief that plans have been scrapped. This could mean that AMD won’t be releasing any new Ryzen CPUs in 2021 and we may have to wait until Zen 4 in 2022 to see anything new.  
&gt;  
&gt;One possible reason for AMD’s alleged canceled lineup could be due to the minimal performance increase when upgrading from Zen 3 to Zen 3+. The increased instructions per clock (IPC) was reported to be anywhere from 3% to 10% on average depending on the applications. Unless AMD were to combine that small boost with something more significant like a shift to a 6nm node, it would make more sense for AMD to skip the refresh and jump directly to Zen 4. This strategy would offer a larger bump in performance with a new architecture that also supports DDR5 memory. Another major contributing factor could be the current silicon chip shortage which is causing AMD to [struggle with restocking]( its existing Ryzen 5000 Series lineup.

 

&gt;Other complications  
&gt;  
&gt;Intel has one of its most ambitious CPUs [releasing later in 2021]( in the form of Alder Lake which is expected to be more powerful than the supposedly canceled AMD Zen 3+, especially while gaming. Intel’s CPUs will also feature a new big.LITTLE hybrid design and PCI Express 5.0. If the Zen 3+ is truly canceled, AMD’s Ryzen 6000 series may have to wait until 2022 to compete with Alder Lake. However, this information is based on rumors and should be taken with a grain of salt for the time being.

1,14,0,1,0,"RX 5700XT DROPPING GPU USAGESo, basically couple days ago i realised that my pc lost it's performance in the most of the games that i play. While playing Forza Horizon 4 i noticed that my fps is around 100 which is not normal because it should be way bigger than that. I found that on the start of the game my FPS is 150-160 and gpu usage is around 95% after spending around 2,3 min in game driving my fps drops to already mentioned 100-110 and there is a drop in GPU usage, instead of 95%+ it is 60-70%. I have seen this problem in many other games not just Forza so it is not game related. Some of you will probably say that it is bottleneck, but i don't think so because my GPU works with Ryzen 7 3700x.   
Full specs are:  
GPU: Gigabyte AMD RX 5700 XT 8gb OC

CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 3700X

RAM: HyperX Fury 16gb 3.200mhz

MBO: Gigabyte X570 Aorus Elite

PSU:  **700W Cooler Master MWE** 

This problem is really pissing me off because im trying to play that are not that good optimized like 7 days to die for example and i can't get over 60fps in that because of my GPU usage drop (Before, without this problem i had more than 90 fps on max settings). I really have no idea what to do about all this stuff, i tried everything i can possibly do. I had heat problems on gpu before, but they are gone pretty much. I am not feeling like switching to Nvidia, i really liked performance with my gpu before this and i want that back. Also, i don't think that problem is related to the new drivers because problem started before i updated drivers.

1,15,0,1,0,"Ryzen 5800x &amp; Fuma 2 temperature concern heading into summer.I bought my new gaming PC last November with a Ryzen 5800x and a Scythe Fuma 2 cooler. Hardware reviews at the time lead me to believe it'd perform not too far from an NH-D15 (I fell for the hype... though to be fair, I expected to pair it with a 5600x but those weren't in stock, so I splurged on an upgraded CPU). 

All through winter it performed well. Never exceeded 80C in Cinebench R23... but that was back when my ambient temp was around 60F / 16C. 

Now in late April my ambient temp is more like 80F / 27C and I expect it to get even warmer in July (it sometimes reaches 90F / 32C ambient in my room!). 

Already while playing No Man's Sky in VR my CPU typically hovers around 75C-80C and spikes to 90C, according to CPUID HWMonitor. 

I realize AMD says that 90C under load is [""typical by design""]( but that just means the CPU is guaranteed to last at least the warranty period (3 years) at that temperature. I'd like to keep mine going a lot longer than that. My old gaming PCs end up becoming hand-me-downs to family members, so they tend to get at least a decade or more of daily use.

I'm using a Phanteks P500A (non digital / mesh case). I don't think airflow should be a concern but I bought a couple extra case fans anyway (they'll be arriving next week).

I'm seriously considering getting an [Arctic Liquid Freezer 2 360]( when they come back in stock, just to ensure cooling **won't** be an issue anymore... is that too crazy?

Any suggestions for what CPU cooler I should be using, given how warm it gets in the summer here? Or should I just stop worrying altogether?

I thought about an NH-D15, but I think it'd block my first ram slot (Tomahawk X570 motherboard, G.Skill Ripjaws memory). In addition, my old PC used an NH-U14S and it was a b*tch to install so I'd kind of like to avoid that difficulty.",ryzen x fuma temperature concern heading summer bought gaming last november ryzen x scythe fuma cooler hardware review time lead believe perform far nh fell hype though fair expected pair x stock splurged upgraded cpu winter performed well never exceeded c cinebench r back ambient temp around f c late april ambient temp like f c expect get even warmer july sometimes reach f c ambient room already playing man sky vr cpu typically hovers around c c spike c according cpuid hwmonitor realize amd say c load typical design mean cpu guaranteed last least warranty period year temperature like keep mine going lot longer old gaming pc end becoming hand down family member tend get least decade daily use using phanteks p non digital mesh case think airflow concern bought couple extra case fan anyway arriving next week seriously considering getting arctic liquid freezer come back stock ensure cooling issue anymore crazy suggestion cpu cooler using given warm get summer stop worrying altogether thought nh think block first ram slot tomahawk x motherboard g skill ripjaws memory addition old used nh u b tch install kind like avoid difficulty

Hi,

I've been trying to troubleshoot issues I'm having with my 1440p 144hz monitor. It's an Acer ED273UR I bought looking to benefit from its freesync with my new 6800xt gpu. However, I'm experiencing some pretty weird behaviour.

It started when I turned on VRR in my amd settings, note that without it being on none of these issues happen but I experience tear in my games. At first I was using my monitor with an HDMI 2.0 cable and wasc experiencing random black screens in games that lasted for a couple of seconds whenever the frames changed rapidly. I dabbled with a few settings but couldn't get it to work. I assumed it would be an issue with the cable and bought a DP 1.4 which arrived today.

I tried turning on VRR again (freesync) in my amd option and despite no longer experiencing those random black screens (so far) I do see some flickering, specially noticeable in titles like path of exile with heave changes in FPS.

now the weird part actually happens when I try to limit my fps on games where I can achieve higher frames than my refresh rate. It doesn't matter whether I do this via amd's radeon chill technology or in game, every time I limit my fps to 140 or below my flickering gets worse, I turned on the refresh rate counter in my monitor and it changes like crazy, I mean several times a second going from 144 down to 75 or lower and back up and this is only the case when I limit the fps in any way. if my fps is below 144 because of the actual PC not being abl to push it higher the refresh rate counter is stable at whatever fps i can achieve, but if I limit it that's when it starts going all over the place and flickering gets very noticeable.

I don't know if this is a GPU or a monitor issue or if there's anything I can do to fix it. according to AMD the monitor is freesync compatible so I really don't know what's going on.",issue xt p hz display hi trying troubleshoot issue p hz monitor acer ed ur bought looking benefit freesync xt gpu however experiencing pretty weird behaviour started turned vrr amd setting note without none issue happen experience tear game first using monitor hdmi cable wasc experiencing random black screen game lasted couple second whenever frame changed rapidly dabbled setting get work assumed issue cable bought dp arrived today tried turning vrr freesync amd option despite longer experiencing random black screen far see flickering specially noticeable title like path exile heave change fps weird part actually happens try limit fps game achieve higher frame refresh rate matter whether via amd radeon chill technology game every time limit fps flickering get worse turned refresh rate counter monitor change like crazy mean several time second going lower back case limit fps way fps actual abl push higher refresh rate counter stable whatever fps achieve limit start going place flickering get noticeable know gpu monitor issue anything fix according amd monitor freesync compatible really know going

Ive managed to find in the AMD CBS settings within my bios that I can set the limit of the EDC / TDC / PPT which I've found 115w for PPT, 100A for the TDC and 80A for the EDC.

1,49,0,1,0,"AMD Online Store: Just how surprising does it get?So, we all know Digital River is a fucking joke and that they run AMD's online store in the background, but the front-face of the store has some actual AMD touches and decisions to it. After today's restock and the website downtime/maintenance, the checkout process does not even work for the 1 remaining product in stock:  


[Drupal, of all things, seriously?](

I'm not entirely surprised, tbh, that AMD would use Drupal for their own CMS and website overall. However, the store being a... store, and not needing ""CMS"" capabilities (and being a billion-dollar company) could have used some love instead of just being a reworked Drupal plugin (which by itself is already bad) that on top of that has to communicate with Digital River's own shit-of-the-art order management and processing system.

Is AMD really running gears for their store that are as low key as a kid with a YouTube tutorial and open-source framework's documentation could do on their free school time? For a billion dollar company? When there are at least a few good options out there from companies that actually specialize in running complete web-stores as a turn-key solution?  


I do understand that investment and cost are key, and that maybe it's not viable to dedicate a team of developers to brew their own state-of-the-art store front and backend... but come on. Does AMD really need the bad PR of Digital River providing customers with shit support and experience and TOP IT OFF with a broken and really bad solution for their store front?  


I mean, I love open-source and have used and developed a bit for Drupal in the past. I don't even agree with a Wordpress solution instead of Drupal in this case, given what this actually is. Drupal isn't the tool for an operation of this nature and size, gentlemen.  


Please, AMD. Hear us out on this: Your online store sucks BIG TIME (due to both DR and YOURSELF) and it is not even secure at this point. PLEASE fix that crap, regardless of COVID and increased demand. It doesn't matter if it doesn't break 9 months from now when demands is a bit lower, it is still just as bad.

1,6,0,1,0,"What's the current best practice with RAM config?I have a 3900X running on a B350 board (bought at launch of the 1700X) with 16 Gb (2x8) of GSkill FlareX 3200 CL14 RAM.

That has worked great - system is fast and stable.

I bought an X570 MB with a view to picking up an 5900X (or maybe even a 5950X drool, drool) but - like everyone else - I have been waiting on supply problems to get sorted out before paying inflated prices. That sexy new MB is sitting on my desk.

I recently learned, though, that Vegas Pro (my video editor software) *really* responds to RAM amount. Moving from 32Gb to 64Gb can drop render times by almost 4x (in what I suspect is related to how Vegas handles effects plugins and task scheduling) and given that I'm on 16Gb, it seems safe to say that the same scaling will apply.

So what I want to do is move from 2x8 to 2x16, with a view towards eventually going 4x16.

I can do this one of 2 ways:

1. Buy a pair of 16Gb sticks, drop them in the B350 board, and wait for the 59xxX purchase before moving to X570; or

2. Buy a pair of 16 Gb sticks, and swap the whole system to X570 now.

My first reflex would be to buy some FlareX 3200 CL14 sticks like I have now (which I know work fine on the B350 board) but I've lost the bubble on what the current Ryzen state of the art is. Maybe there is a better choice.

So then, what is the current Ryzen best practice, and how does it interact with 3900X/B350, 3900X/X570, 59xxX,/X570?

1,29,0,1,0,"Samsung Odyssey G7 in HDR + Radeon Software = Rich buttery smoothness::TL:DR::
If your screen seems dim, washed, over saturated and solving one causes the other, the answer for me was going into Radeon Software &gt; settings &gt; Display &gt; and setting Color Depth to 10 bpc and Display Color Enhancement to Vivid Gaming. Along with the fastest refresh rate (non-MBR), oooh boy does this monitor look Good! Deep and rich colors, dark blacks without losing visibility and nice brights. My complete settings profile on the monitor is below the main post.
::TL:DR::


So, i thought I'd share my experience using an RX 6900 XT on this new monitor I got trying to get the most out of this beast. Seems to me the G7 monitors are calibrated to an NVIDIA card and so out of the box, I wasn't as impressed with this $700 monitor (I got the 27in) as I thought I'd be after testing the LG 850 and going through a number of reviews on the G7.

After a ton of tweaking and visually testing on a number of apps and games, I finally found the solution to the problems I was having! Read the TL:DR for the details on that. Will need to retest the LG 850 i have and see if these settings do that monitor any justice as well.  The washed look was even worse on that especially with HDR and any attempt to make it more vivid and contrasted was met with bad colors, yellow whites, and undefined dark blacks that also show the black screen bleed. Just really hard to look at when playing a game like RE: 2. I'll probably still keep the G7 because of the refresh rate and buttery smooth response times even if the Radeon Software solves these issues. And I doubt the LG's HDR will compare no matter what I do..Will definitely post my results on here later though.

Hopefully this helped anyone who was also less than impressed with the out the box look of the G7 or after twealong the settings on the monitor itself. Let me know if you had similar issues, different solutions, and/or id this helped or didn't help.

Below are my monitor and Radeon software settings.

G7 HDR Settings:
Brightneess - 80
Contrast - 75
Sharpness - 68
Color - R30/G30/B50 (varies from game to game where red is decreased and green is increased from here)
Freesync - off

Dynamic contrast - worth noting i turned this off before turning on HDR in windows. It is not an option when HDR is off and not sure if this had an effect on the visual quality of the HDR as I have not tested that variable but I'm inclined to think it does not matter.

Radeon Software settings:
Everything except the color depth and color enhancement are left at default or disabled.

Full Build will be corrected later today, but i don't know the correct names of everything.

Mainboard: MSI MAG B550M Mortar WiFi

Back to the Ryzen CPUs:
The first one held for about 16 Months but one day without any load to speak of the screens go dark and nothing else is working. After restarting fans a running, but no image appears. 
CPU LED is on.
I removed the CPU, installed it again, no change.
I exchanged the CPU for a Athlon 200g PC is booting again, but with no network capabilities. Since the CPU had bent pins(corrected) from a past accident, I thought this were the very late consequences, so i bought a new one.
The new one installed - everything is working again.
Barely 2 Months later the CPU died again without a lot of load, everything same as before. My Athlon Booted again but again without working network adapter. 
I RMA'ed it with AMD, they sent me a new one, everything  is fine AGAIN. That was 6 days ago, yesterday evening my PC died again. Again with the same issues. 
This time I didn't exchange the CPU again... I am just burned out from this.

1,129,0,1,0,"USB even with the latest BIOS fix seems to still be fundamentally broken.After many days trying to fix my new AMD system I have come to the conclusion that the latest BIOS update that is supposed to fix the USB issues is just covering it up, but does not really fix it. I indeed do not get the mouse/keyboard freezes anymore every 2 seconds, but almost none of my USB devices connected through any USB hub (different brands) work where on my old system I had no issues.

Also when debugging USB in Linux (usbmon, wireshark usb sniffing) it is clear that things are dropping out.

I did set PCI-E to Gen3 and disabled the global C-state etc. Made sure all OCing is disabled and even tried underclocking.

What happens in my case:

- My G27 Logitech wheel is detected as a Driving Force wheel on all ports except one (the red 10Gb USB 3.2 one).

- Most devices connected via a hub do not work and I get a ""device descriptor read/64, error -32"" (Linux) / ""device descriptor request failed"" (Device Manager) error.

From what I've heard I am still the lucky one. This same setup worked 100% fine on my old Z170A Intel-based setup.

I am sad to acknowledge that I may have to return all components within the 2 week return window including the 5900x which I got for a good price. I have no time to first go through all kind of standard support steps of which most I've already done.
Building up the new PC and debugging all issues took me 3 days. I personally believe this is a fundamental AMD chipset issue and the latest BIOS update is just covering it up (it is just a matter of time until it causes other issues). From what I've learned from 2 different people, even a PCI-E USB extension card will still have this issue.

I really hope they can resolve this all as good competition against Intel is highly needed.

So I'm a bit lost on how Freesync works and what to do with v sync. I just got a new 1080p 60Hz monitor that supports Freesync (btw there are two modes: standard engine and ultimate engine... which should I use?).

After I select one of the two engines on the monitor, do I enable Freesync somewhere in Radeon settings? And should I be using v sync as well?

I just simply want to know how exactly does Freesync work and how do I use it (for gaming).

Thank you in advance!

I have continued looking for mini pc's, however the one I was aiming for is gone, the one with the ryzen 4500u, but I still want to know how the others ranked up to it.

I wanted to ask how each of these **Ryzen 7 3750h vs ryzen 4350g vs ryzen 4500u** ranks compared to each other in terms of both processing power, and graphics (seperatley? )

 ( I included ryzen 5 3550h just in case it is viable)

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I dont know if I am wrong, but as far as I can tell in terms of processing power it is:

1. Ryzen 5 4500u - 6 cores
2. ryzen 3 pro 4350g - 4 cores
3. ryzen 7 3750h - 4 cores
4. ryzen 7 3550h - 4 cores
5. ryzen 3 2200g - 4 cores ( old pc)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of graphics I am not sure, since I am not sure if vega improved over generations or stayed the same.

but would the rankings be:

1. ryzen 3 pro 4350g - has vega 6?, 1700mhz, 6 graphics cores

2. ryzen 7  3750h - has vega 10, 1400mhz, 10 graphics core

3.ryzen 5 4500u - has vega 6? 1500mhz, 6 graphics cores

4. ryzen 5 3550h- has vega 8, 1200 mhz, 8 graphics cores

5.ryzen 3 2200g - vega 8, 1100mhz, 8 graphics cores  (old pc)

&amp;#x200B;

Judging by this I would expext ryzen 5 4500u to be the best in both processing and gpu, but since it not available, would ryzen 3 pro 4350g or ryzen 7 3750h be far behind?

1,2,0,1,0,"RMA ExperienceI just went through the process to go through AMD RMA, and I just wanted to put my experience here for others.

Ever since I got my 5600X around Christmas time, I've had nothing but issues with it. Crashing, poor performance, you name it, I had it. It would *sometimes* work on default settings, doing anything with PBO was completely out of the question in lieu of crashing, and was overall not the greatest experience. It was very noticeably unstable and ran very hot and performed worse than nearly any other 5600X I had seen. Despite all the troubleshooting I did it never really seemed to improve, and thus I came to the conclusion that my CPU was defective.

So, RMA process. Overall it wasn't too hard to get all the information they needed, though I do wish that they had explicitly said EVERYTHING they wanted before I did anything. I had to clean and repaste my CPU twice, not just once, because they wanted a picture of the serial number on the CPU, and then wanted a picture of the same thing except with a paper handwritten note of the RMA service number for some reason. That was pretty annoying and I wish they explicitly stated they wanted that in the beginning, but otherwise not a big deal.

The whole shipping process, once my RMA got approved, took about 2 weeks. While this may not be fully under AMD's control, this, in my opinion, is FAR too long for an RMA process, especially compared to someone like EVGA who can get an RMA done in under a week easily. I can't imagine going through this if I had a lot of time-sensitive work that needed done.

But in the end, it actually ended out pretty good for me. The new 5600X I received not only runs cooler and performs better, but I can now also use CO/PBO without crashing! While I am still overall happy with the product I (eventually) received, I can't help but feel that AMD could be handling their shipping a lot better. I do work off my computer, and while it isn't necessarily time-sensitive, I potentially lost a lot of business being out a computer for 2 weeks. Despite that it's still an overall net positive from me.

Would love to know how other people's RMA experience went. :)",rma experiencei went process go amd rma wanted put experience others ever since got x around christmas time nothing issue crashing poor performance name sometimes work default setting anything pbo completely question lieu crashing overall greatest experience noticeably unstable ran hot performed worse nearly x seen despite troubleshooting never really seemed improve thus came conclusion cpu defective rma process overall hard get information needed though wish explicitly said everything wanted anything clean repaste cpu twice wanted picture serial number cpu wanted picture thing except paper handwritten note rma service number reason pretty annoying wish explicitly stated wanted beginning otherwise big deal whole shipping process rma got approved took week may fully amd control opinion far long rma process especially compared someone like evga get rma done week easily imagine going lot time sensitive work needed done end actually ended pretty good x received run cooler performs better also use co pbo without crashing still overall happy product eventually received help feel amd could handling shipping lot better work computer necessarily time sensitive potentially lost lot business computer week despite still overall net positive love know people rma experience went

I just (for the first time in 20+ years) built a new PC (personal+work):
5950x
Noctua 12s
x570 Taichi
rx570

I intend, eventually (if ever), to get a 5800xt for my base system (Fedora) and run various VM's (ten or so total) including a Win 10 gaming VM (for which I hope to pass-thru an RTX 3080).  Also running multi-RAID HD's for mass storage with 2 WD SSD's for main storage.

Sitting on my desktop in open air (not in case yet) I was still somewhat surprised:
The Corsair PSU says its fan will only spin up if it self-detects it needs cooling.  For the past hour it has not spun up since initial power-on spin-up yet cool to touch.

The Noctua 12s is insanely quiet.  It is spinning but I hear nothing unless I lean in closely where I can barely hear the air passing over the fins of the cooler.

Even the old rs570 fans only spin up occasionally and very slowly.  They are the loudest component and they are just a very, very low hum.

All to the point that my temps, even when running s-tui stress, never get above 40C average with a 63C max.

The hottest thing (to the touch) on this system seems to be the large motherboard heat sink that covers the two SSD's.  I am thinking the case fans might mitigate that but, as-is, when I say it is the ""hottest"" it is only warm to the touch, not really 'hot'.

These value are displayed in asus gpu tweak II and somehow confirmed by amd driver tuning panel which shows 2509 mhz clock as the default one.

1,2,0,1,0,"AMD Radeon Software High CPU and Power usageRecently I purchased and HP Pavillion Notebook, the last few days I notice that since startup the AMD Radeon Software, runs always at the top of the task manager list, sorted by CPU or Power usage. The problem is not the resources cosumption but the CPU temperatures that are always above 70°C for every core, putting the fans at the highest rpm setting all the time (My normal temperatures are about 40-50°C) . 

Before writing this post I researched a bit about the matter and I found out that this problem was affiliated with the ReLive service. The problem is that my laptop does have the Ryzen 7 4800H CPU and a dedicated GPU to use for graphics and so, following the steps for the ReLive issue is not solving anything due to the fact that the Radeon Software does not even have a tab for recording. Also in another forum a user wrote that the issue was solved by itself when updated windows 10 to version 20H2, a version already installed on my system and the problem still occurs. In this part I should point out that no updates were done on my laptop when I noticed this. 

For the time being I just shut down the process and all is back to normal, but this is not a solution. Does anybody have the same problem, or has any idea why is this happening and how to fix this ?

So what board should I go with considering the fact they are both new in the box? If that matter, my next upgrade to the rig will probably be a new Ryzen 7 CPU (either 3000 or 5000, depends on the price), and I might upgrade to 32GB RAM as well, adding 2 sticks to my current 8x2 3200Mhz setup or buying 2x16 kit 3600Mhz if I end up buying a 5th gen CPU.

I can resume by changing the sample rate from the audio interface.

When I first got my rig everything was running great, but now about 2.5 months after using the machine nearly exclusively for VR and a couple of games I've been running into issues when I'm playing titles where the headset goes gray for a few seconds and all my controllers basically reset their connection with the machine. Occasionally on longer gray-outs I'll get the sound ding like something has been unplugged and plugged back into the PC.

I'm THINKING it's the USB issue from previous posts on here. I have not updated to the newest bios yet (still rocking the one from the end of Jan) but I've been waiting for MSI to release their next update just from what I've seen with issues with the profiles not loading properly on here to see if it addresses it.

What's weird is that this issue only started occurring within the last 3 weeks or so, and at first I thought it was the adaptive SS kicking in on the index so I turned that off, but it's still doing it. It seems like any time the GPU or the SSD is hit hard is when the drop occurs making me think it's related to the USB issue.

I believe there is a USB port or two on the back that bypasses the chipset and interfaces directly with the CPU, I'm wondering if that might be something to try. 

Anyone else with a similar setup experiencing the same thing?",question experience vr pci e gen usbso rig x msi x hawk rtx tb pci e gen hard drive valve index first got rig everything running great month using machine nearly exclusively vr couple game running issue playing title headset go gray second controller basically reset connection machine occasionally longer gray out get sound ding like something unplugged plugged back thinking usb issue previous post updated newest bios yet still rocking one end jan waiting msi release next update seen issue profile loading properly see address weird issue started occurring within last week first thought adaptive s kicking index turned still seems like time gpu ssd hit hard drop occurs making think related usb issue believe usb port two back bypass chipset interface directly cpu wondering might something try anyone else similar setup experiencing thing

So I've basically just set a date, set it and forget it and get by with what I've got. Then the rumors started kicking about as of late, that Warhol has been removed from internal road maps. AMD did this with 7nm, when they went all in. Given they don't want to let up, I feel like these rumors may be true, and this may be another 'all in' moment going to 5nm and skipping 6nm.

**2 - Is there any performance hit, by using all the DRAM slots?**

1,33,0,1,0,"AMD Ryzen 7 2700x + RTX 2070 and still low fps?I seem to be getting inconsistent fps and frametimes in almost every game I play.

In  CSGO, I usually average around 300 fps until getting into a gunfight.  Once I do, my fps drops to around 100 - 140 and it feels really bad.  Even when the fps spikes up to 230 again, I still feel like there's  input delay.

The same thing can be  said for Apex Legends as well. I usually hover around 140 - 150 fps,  but when I get into a gunfight, my fps drops in the range of 90 fps to  130 fps and the game feels very laggy even when going back to 144 fps.  Because it feels laggy, I also feel like there's input lag in my mouse  movements.

It's been irritating me lately and I wanted to know what I can do to resolve this issue.

My Specs:  
CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 2700x  
GPU: ASUS ROG STRIX RTX 2070 8GB  
RAM: 2x8 Corsair Vengeance 16GB 3000mhz (slotted correctly)  
Motherboard: ASUS ROG STRIX X470-F Gaming  
PSU: Corsair RMx 850W 80+ Gold Edition

I  already did some troubleshooting to try to investigate the issue. My  temps for both the CPU and GPU are fine as they are well below 70; the  CPU averages around 65 while the GPU averages around 50 when gaming. In  addition, the clock speeds for both seem to be fine as the CPU clock  speeds are around 4.0GHz while the GPU clock speeds are around 2.0GHz.  Finally, the usages for both seem to be fine as the GPU usage hovers  around 60% to 98% while the CPU usage hovers around 20 - 50%

1,5,0,1,0,"Tips to buy Hot! items such as GPU/CPU or Consoles! Hey guys! I’ve been super lucky to pick up a RTX 3080 and a 5800x! Wanted to share some tips and tricks I have found to help the community out. Please upvote this if it helps you out.

Step #1. If you can, get any model possible. If you want a GPU the fastest, you might have to settle for a terrible AIB card but look a card is a card. If you stick to only 1 model, stick to that model. Keep refreshing it whenever there is a guaranteed drop time.

Step #2. Setup an account on every store such as Amazon, BestBuy and Newegg etc. Setup Apple Pay if you have the capability. It is always the fastest on most stores such as Newegg. It’s a 1 click checkout option and works the best (That’s how I got my card). If you have a microcenter, go to that microcenter on their designated drop days.

Step #3. Do not support scalpers. As much as they tempt you, DO NOT PAY OVER MSRP. When you buy something from them, it gives them more money to spend and keep scalping.

Step #4. Use other discord’s to help give you notifications. Make sure to have discord notifications get sent to your phone and use the mobile app for the fastest checkout.

1,64,0,1,0,"POSSIBLE SOLUTION if you are experiencing driver timeout crashes on RX480/580 with 21.3 and 21.4TL;DR: Getting the latest Windows Updates might fix it for you too.

Whenever I turned on my PC, I would get one or two blackscreen crashes followed by the AMD Error Reporting tool telling me I had a driver timeout. These could happen while browsing the web on a chromium browser (even when no video or image was on screen), or while playing a game (I could reliably reproduce it by opening the driver software overlay).

After reading that some Nvidia users were having issues with Windows recently, I decided to check if Windows Update had anything for me, and after an update and reboot, I have yet to see the crashes pop up again. I even messed around with Performance Tuning while at it.

One thing that I find weird is that this new update won't appear in the history. It says my last update was on April 15. (

I thought this was worth a new post since they are very useful when you google AMD driver questions and can instantly get an answer.",possible solution experiencing driver timeout crash rx tl dr getting latest window update might fix whenever turned get one two blackscreen crash followed amd error reporting tool telling driver timeout could happen browsing web chromium browser even video image screen playing game could reliably reproduce opening driver software overlay reading nvidia user issue window recently decided check window update anything update reboot yet see crash pop even messed around performance tuning one thing find weird update appear history say last update april thought worth post since useful google amd driver question instantly get answer

Coming from an i5 3570k with a gtx 970, switching to a Ryzen 3600, keeping the gpu for now.  Yes i know, rant..''but that gpu is soo old and bad'' yeah..might be true but 1. gpu prices 2. games i play. I mainly play stuff like league of legends, path of exile, elite dangerous, world of warships.. stuff like that, gpu performance is not my issue here. What is an issue tho are the facts path of exile is heavily cpu bound and i cant literaly not play and enjoy it without stuttering, and the other games i play do run above 144fps no problem BUT i still sit on an almost constant 90-100% cpu load while doing so so EVERYTHING background related like browsing stuff on the side, watching streams on the side becomes nearly impossible. i just need more cpu power for now.

Now B450 vs B550.  i know technicly B550 would be the obvious choice because ''its newer''  but that kinda only holds true if pricings are similar and i want my build to be ''cheap'' or lets say ''price efficient'' 

I can buy a B450 Tomahawk MAX II for 80Euros right now while Boards like B450M Mortar Max goes as low as 65Euros. Similar B550 Boards like the Msi B550 A Pro cost 120Euros and the only cheaper option would be something like a Gigabyte Gaming X V2 at 96Euros. I want to keep the option open to upgrade to a Ryzen 5xxx in like 5 years for example just because it feels nice to have the option to but the tomahawk 450 supports it too and for a price efficient budget build a 40Euros difference on the mainboard is actually pretty big for pcie4 that i will probably never even use.  The Gaming X V2 is something i could live with since its both quite similar but i heard so bad things about their vrms with 5xxx (wich in return is kinda dumb if i gonna buy that for the option to use them later on)

Key things I was looking for was support for 2, maybe 3 M.2 drives in PCIe 4 mode.  From what I have read, I believe the issue with this has been addressed with the newer AGESA v1.2.0.2 update. 

Anyone have suggestion for good, stable board - looking to spend up to $400.

Also, regarding stability - what are general thoughts on ECC ram? There are a lot of opinions out there, looking to get some more I guess. It seems if I go that route, ram selection is limited and speed seems to be as well to 2666 or 3200 from Nemex - have not heard of them before today.

For what i could investigate, maybe (just maybe) it could be a incompatibility with the Corsair memory, i bet with INTEL i would not had this problem.

I read if you go with AMD you need to choose very carefully the RAM's to use with it since compatibility models is very reduced compared to INTEL.

I'm about to request a switch to the store for a 10900k + a compatible mother.

Buying new memories just to make the 5900x happy is out of my budget.

3 weeks ago I bought compulsively a Sapphire 6800XT Nitro+ OC for 1190€ (ebay).

This weeks I managed to buy a reference 6800XT MB &amp; a 6700XT from the amd store.

There is a guy in my town that want to exchange my nitro+ for his 3080 FE.

What GPU should I keep ?  


* 6800XT Nitro+ (Coil Whine in some games menus but not in games thanks to AMD Chill Features).
* 6800XT MB AMD, because it's cheaper &amp; good enough.
* Lowering my performances &amp; keeping the 6700XT.
* Exchange the Nitro for the 3080FE, sell it on the after market or maybe use it.

My setup : B450, 5600X, Freesync 1440p Monitors.

*(I intend to sell the remaining GPU with a short margin to get little money)*

I already tried to sell my Nitro+ at the same price I got it, but since 1 week ... no luck.

Please don't throw stones at me too quickly , I know the choice I have right now is crazy during this shortage but it's been nearly 3 months I try to get a new GPU &amp; since I'm unemployed extra cash is welcomed.

Thanks in advance,

1,10,0,1,0,"Meaning of AMD hardware names (CPUs, GPUs, motherboard chipsets)Numbers with three or four digits, sometimes a letter as well... What do all these names mean?

That strange number should be separated into first, second and other digits like this: 6|9|00 (6900).

First digit is the generation. New hardware will increment this digit. The best is 5, except for GPUs.  
Second digit is the model. Better hardware has a higher second digit. The best is 9 (very expensive).  
Other digits (one or two) are often zero (0), other values mean better performance than the 0 or 00.

# AMD CPU names (What does Ryzen 5 5600X actually mean?)

First digit (5 in 5600X) is the generation. A higher first digit is important, it means newer hardware.  
Newer AMD CPUs have higher single core performance, as well as better RAM compatibility.  
Zen CPUs begin with 1 or 2 (for APUs), Zen+ with 2 or 3, Zen 2 with 3 or 4, Zen 3 with 5 (a jump).

Second digit (6 in 5600X) is the model. A higher second digit means more cores, better performance.  
The best CPUs have 9 as the second digit, they are very useful for productivity (like video editing).  
1, 2 or 3 means Ryzen 3, they are quad core CPUs useful for basic usage, as well as basic gaming.  
4, 5 or 6 means Ryzen 5, they are 6 core CPUs, good for gaming and they are usually the best value.  
7 or 8 means Ryzen 7, they are 8 core CPUS, the best for gaming and good for productivity software.  
9 means Ryzen 9, the best for productivity. They have at least 12 cores. This includes Threadripper.

The last two digits are used for differentiating Ryzen 9 and Threadripper CPUs. Like Ryzen 9 5950X.

A CPU ending in XT is better than the same CPU ending in X, which is better than not ending in a letter.  
A CPU ending in G is a desktop APU. It has integrated graphics, can be used without a discrete GPU.  
A CPU ending in GE is an OEM-only lower powered (35 W) version of a desktop APU (ending in G).  
A CPU ending in WX is a workstation Threadripper CPU with better single core performance than Epyc.  
A CPU ending in AF is a refresh on 12 nm instead of 14 nm. Like Ryzen 3 1200 AF and Ryzen 5 1600 AF.  
A CPU ending in U is a low power laptop CPU, one ending in H is a high performance laptop CPU.  
CPUs ending in HS or HX are still high performance laptop CPUs. S is lower power, X is the opposite.

# AMD GPU names (What does Radeon RX 5800 XT actually mean?)

First digit (5 in 5800 XT) is the generation. A higher first digit is important, it means newer hardware.  
Newer AMD GPUs may be built on better process nodes and they have better performance, of course.  
There are older series with three digits (GCN) and newer series with four digits (RDNA-based GPUs).

Second digit (8 in 5800 XT) is the model. It starts with 5 for entry level and ends with 9 for high end.  
RX 580 is actually middle range, while RX 590 is still middle range, but newer (on a 12 nm process).

The only suffix is XT, which means that RDNA is much better and a competition for NVIDIA, as well.

# AMD chipset names (What does an X570 chipset actually mean?)

First digit (5 in X570) is the generation. It is 3 for Zen CPUs, 4 for Zen+ and 5 for Zen 2 and Zen 3.  
The compatibility is more complicated than that. Sometimes a BIOS update may be necessary.

Second digit (7 in X570) always corresponds with the prefixed letter: 2 for A, 5 for B, 7 for X. Just that.

There are no suffixes, but there is a prefix which can be A (entry level), B (mainstream), X (high end).  
A series motherboards do not allow overclocking. X series are not actually necessary for most people.

There are also Threadripper motherboards, with chipsets X399 (Zen and Zen+) and TRX40 (Zen 2).",meaning amd hardware name cpu gpus motherboard chipsets number three four digit sometimes letter well name mean strange number separated first second digit like first digit generation hardware increment digit best except gpus second digit model better hardware higher second digit best expensive digit one two often zero value mean better performance amd cpu name ryzen x actually mean first digit x generation higher first digit important mean newer hardware newer amd cpu higher single core performance well better ram compatibility zen cpu begin apus zen zen zen jump second digit x model higher second digit mean core better performance best cpu second digit useful productivity like video editing mean ryzen quad core cpu useful basic usage well basic gaming mean ryzen core cpu good gaming usually best value mean ryzen core cpu best gaming good productivity software mean ryzen best productivity least core includes threadripper last two digit used differentiating ryzen threadripper cpu like ryzen x cpu ending xt better cpu ending x better ending letter cpu ending g desktop apu integrated graphic used without discrete gpu cpu ending ge oem lower powered w version desktop apu ending g cpu ending wx workstation threadripper cpu better single core performance epyc cpu ending af refresh nm instead nm like ryzen af ryzen af cpu ending u low power laptop cpu one ending h high performance laptop cpu cpu ending h hx still high performance laptop cpu lower power x opposite amd gpu name radeon rx xt actually mean first digit xt generation higher first digit important mean newer hardware newer amd gpus may built better process node better performance course older series three digit gcn newer series four digit rdna based gpus second digit xt model start entry level end high end rx actually middle range rx still middle range newer nm process suffix xt mean rdna much better competition nvidia well amd chipset name x chipset actually mean first digit x generation zen cpu zen zen zen compatibility complicated sometimes bios update may necessary second digit x always corresponds prefixed letter b x suffix prefix entry level b mainstream x high end series motherboards allow overclocking x series actually necessary people also threadripper motherboards chipsets x zen zen trx zen

As stated in the title, would anyone here with one of those CPUs and uses python be willing to run one of this benchmark for me?  

It does not take very long although you might have to run it a few times just to get an average number. Also, it would be helpful if you can state whether you're using intel MKL (+ version number) or OpenBLAS. For MKL, you can find out your version number by doing:

    import mkl
    mkl.get_version_string()

Some background:

I'm sure we are familiar with the issue regarding [intel mkl]( running slower on AMD cpus by now.

However, I'm just curious as to how well the current TOTL AMD CPU's do regarding Python workloads which is not commonly talked about in consumer benchmarks. I know they're hard to get at the moment but I'm really considering upgrading my existing desktop in the future.

1,47,0,1,0,"Is 5000 series CPU's Limited Without PBO (My experience with the 5950x)hey everyone  
Ive had my 5950x for just over a week now and my experience has been interesting to say the least. After putting it into my system I found it very underwhelming with only a 3.8ghz all core boost on aida64 and cinebench r23 with very high temperatures altogether. after research, I found a lot of other people were having the same issue such as optimumtech and his itx motherboards making me think that motherboards were an issue. With PBO on just set to enabled in bios, it definitely improves the all core boost going to 4.45-4.5ghz but temperatures were EXTREMELY close to 90  
The temperatures actually ended up being a really bad thermal paste (thanks corsair) and after fixing this my temps did drop a fair amount into the 80s on load with PBO which I'm ok with but stock I was hoping the lower temperatures would increase all core boost but alas it did not. just to make sure I wasnt going paranoid I went back and looked at youtubers reviews  
jayz2cents saids his boosted to 4.3 stock  
Hardware unboxed said his was 4.195  
Kit Guru had a very similar experience to mine with 3.8 stock and 4.5 boost

&amp;#x200B;

performance wise, it's great. ONLY for games that are hard to run. I get 150+ fps 1440p res on high settings for warzone, PUBG, Raft, and solid 60 fps for genshin impact.

but for valorant, I get 120-180 fps on the lowest settings possible 1440p. I am not too sure on what is limiting the performance here. Many youtube benchmarks shows me that I should be getting like at least 200 fps+ on the highest settings possible. I used to get 150-200 fps on lowest setting for gtx 1060 3gb so I expected 400-500 fps with the same settings on rx 6700 xt. I tried high settings and fps was still similar, 120-180 fps.

Any simple solutions to these?

Also what is amd gpu's best with? like the games or game engines. I was told that stock minecraft is not one of them. (I installed optifine for Java minecraft but only went from 60 ish fps to 100 ish fps on same settings)

If I want to mostly play games like minecraft, valorant, league of legends, gta v, is this amd rx 6700 xt not the gpu to go for? should I try to get a nvidia rtx 30 series card? All I wanted was a really fast GPU that is an easy plug in and play that would give me 3 times the performance of my gtx 1060 gpu  

and is there a need for me to upgrade my motherboard to get the full 3200 mhz ram speed? 

do I also need a better case?

When I play Warzone, I get around 115-135 FPS, but when I play Warzone with OBS on (I don't even need to be streaming or recording anything, just having OBS on alone), and I'll lose FPS to where my average FPS sits around 90-110. If this is a ram issue, I'm thinking if I upgrade my ram to 64GB, will I be able to get the same amount of FPS in Warzone with OBS on, than I normally do without OBS? I assume the reason why I'm losing FPS in Warzone with OBS is due to not having enough ram to satisfy both Warzone and OBS.

But if this is not a ram issue, but a problem with the cpu itself, is there perhaps some setting I need to enable for the 5950x to keep performance up despite having OBS on? I'm of course running OBS as administrator, have game mode and hardware graphics acceleration on.

GPU could be the third culprit here, but considering that Warzone is mainly a cpu intensive program, I'm not really thinking too much about that.

I should also note, that whenever I try to tab out of Warzone (with OBS on) and try to browse something on the net, my system will act pretty slow... I wasn't exactly expecting something like this from the so called beefy 5950x, but yet here we are.

I switched from backing up using SFTP to backing up directly to an USB 3.0 external hard drive (connected to the PC with the USB 3.2 Gen2 port on the back panel). This is were I first discovered very weird USB behaviour. What seemed a little odd at first was that sometimes Windows Explorer goes to “Not Responding” when simply showing the contents of the drive. But it got worse.

After copying about 100 GB (with speeds of 40-130 MB/s) the transfer rates started to drop to zero every few seconds. Also the transfer rate won’t go beyond 1-2 MB/s anymore for that copying process.

Stopping the copying process makes things even worse. Some of the things that happened:

\- Windows Explorer stopped showing any drives at all, it didn’t even show “This PC” anymore.

\- The backup drive wasn’t readable anymore and had to be formatted to work again

\- Files that got already copied had different binary contents than the source files

\- The whole system got unresponsive

\- Ryzen Master didn’t show any values any more (no temps, no voltages, …)

I tried another PC where all the files were copied without any problems. So I am pretty sure about the external hard drive being ok.

I couldn’t find anything related to this behaviour because it seems most people have problems that their USB devices randomly disconnect which I never had. Also while copying I never experienced any USB disconnects.

Has anybody experienced something like that or read something on the internet about that? I really would appreciate some other thoughts about this!",ryzen x usb transfer problemsi x msi meg x unify bios version c va comboam piv heard usb disconnect issue never experienced switched backing using sftp backing directly usb external hard drive connected usb gen port back panel first discovered weird usb behaviour seemed little odd first sometimes window explorer go responding simply showing content drive got worse copying gb speed mb transfer rate started drop zero every second also transfer rate go beyond mb anymore copying process stopping copying process make thing even worse thing happened window explorer stopped showing drive even show anymore backup drive readable anymore formatted work file got already copied different binary content source file whole system got unresponsive ryzen master show value temp voltage tried another file copied without problem pretty sure external hard drive ok find anything related behaviour seems people problem usb device randomly disconnect never also copying never experienced usb disconnect anybody experienced something like read something internet really appreciate thought

1,255,0,1,0,"No, AMD never had a website ""vulnerability""!It's Gecko here, creator of [PartAlert]( \- one of the fastest public stock alerting systems in Europe. I've been helping gamers get their GPUs from various retailers for the past 8 months, so I have an in-depth understanding of how various retailers operate.

AMD has been getting a lot of flak over the past few days, with multiple media outlets picking up a so-called AMD.com ""vulnerability"" and running with it without really bothering to check their facts:

* [
* [
* [

\*sigh\*, where do we start?

**Here's a controversial opinion**: Over the past few months, the team at AMD has been one of the most proactive in their fight against bots and they deserve some respect for that.

# Chapter 1: Direct add-to-cart links and complete botting free-for-all

For a long time, Digital River interface at shop.amd.com allowed people (and bots) to completely bypass [ website and order directly through Digital River, bypassing any anti-bot measures they might have had in place. DigitalRiver is well-known for being easily botted, which is also why Nvidia stopped relying on them for the fulfillment of Founders Edition GPUs.

Every week, various forums such as Hardwareluxx would publicly post new direct add to cart links, that looked similar to this:

[

That link would lead you to this page, away from the slow AMD.com website and away from any required captchas: 



These links would quickly be patched, usually, the day after they became publicly known. There is more than one way to craft these special links, so this kept going for more than a few weeks.

We also had:

* [
* [
* [
* [

*I hope AMD found the last one as amusing as I did when I first crafted it. :-)*

There were other combinations of various domains and `Action` parameters, but you get the idea. Every Thursday, people who knew about these links would frantically refresh them and often manage to check out faster than most people even knew the cards were in stock.

Caching on [ *sucks* and you would often have to wait for 5-15min *after the drop* to even see the Add to Cart button appear.

# Chapter 2: The so-called ""vulnerability""

About a month ago, AMD blocked or patched all publicly known direct add to cart links described above - at least to my knowledge. Aside from direct add-to-cart links, there was at least one method of checking the stock status left unprotected.

## Breaking news: Add to cart button adds the product to your cart 😲

Add to Cart buttons are very useful creatures, when you click on them, you usually expect 1 of 2 things to happen - either the product is added to your cart because it's in stock, or you see a message saying that the product is out of stock.

And that's exactly what happens on AMD.com - this is *normal* and to be *expected*. Let's dive a bit deeper into this.

Let's say that you can see the add to cart button for Ryzen 5800X on AMD.com. Here's what happens when you click on that button:

1. Your browser sends a request to [
2. The server replies with *some* data.

* If the product was successfully added to the cart (indicating that the product is in stock), you will see this pop up: 



* If the product is out of stock, it won't be added to your cart, and you'll see the following pop up:



Looking at the raw response from the server, you can see that the successful response contains the product name and ""Go to checkout"" text here: 



If we circle back to the first 2 posts on this topic, the Redditors call attention to *other* information that's included in this successful response, namely some data from DigitalRiver, which in addition to binary in-stock/out-of-stock status also includes the exact quantity of products in stock: 



While one could argue that this is a sensitive information leak (depending on whether AMD considers the number of products available in each drop confidential), this data does not help auto-checkout bots buy the products.

**This is not something that AMD can patch**, this is simply how **ALL** websites work, when you click on a button, something happens and you (hopefully) get feedback on what has happened - in this case, whether the product was added to your cart, or not.

**Let me be clear, this reported ""vulnerability"" did not give bots any significant advantage,** despite what the previous posts said or what the media reported.

Bots simply used this information to know when the products were in stock. There's nothing for AMD to patch.

People that were running scripts based on this method for alerts, but then completed checkout manually, were able to skip 1 step of the process (adding the product to their cart).

This is not a ""vulnerability"", it's just partial automation of the checkout flow that everyone has to go through.

# Chapter 3: The aftermath

After the direct add-to-cart links were patched, AMD likely saw a huge increase in traffic to their main storefront. Not accounting for other communities, over 60,000 users from PartAlert, as well as all of the bots hitting their add-to-cart API, were suddenly directed to [ (hosted by AMD) instead of shop.amd.com (hosted by DigitalRiver).

AMD's website (*and PayPal*) completely crashed during the following 2 drops. This probably lead them to implement the captcha which appears every time you click on the Add to Cart button.

Requiring a captcha to be solved before every add-to-cart attempt presents a non-trivial obstacle to bots. Bots used to be able to check for stock 100+ times per second if they wanted, without incurring any significant costs, while captcha-solving services usually cost around $3/1000 attempts.

This is where we are now - bots that have to either massively slow down or pay the price of captcha-solving services.

In addition to captchas, AMD has also added other bot protection mechanisms over the past two weeks. While I can't comment on their effectiveness against auto-checkout bots, it does show ongoing progress in their fight against the bots &amp; scalpers.

## TL;DR:

Post #1: There was no vulnerability in the first place. AMD sent over a t-shirt and the entire story was blown out of proportion.

Post #2: Misguided reply to the original post, AMD continuing to expose the stock quantity does not give the bots any advantage.

## Current AMD.com situation

For the past few weeks, it's been relatively easy to get your hands on AMD.com GPUs. In Europe they usually drop anywhere from a few hundred to 1k+ units every single week.

1,5,0,1,0,"5950X strange thermalsHello everyone, I recently got a 5950X as an upgrade from my old 7th gen i5, before buying I've seen reviews that it runs hot, and thermals are higher than my previous CPU as expected, but it seems disproportionate compared to the numberNoctua of cores utilized. I'm using a noctua NH-D15 with a single fan config.

TLDR: Is a single threaded workload on a 5950X being hotter normal than an all core workload normal/is there an explanation for it?

Cinebench R23 Benchmark scores + temps:

**Single Core:** 1593  
CPU Max: 62.6 C  
CPU Average: 60.2 C  
CPU Min (normal desktop usage): 38.4 C

**Multi Core:**  
CPU Max: 59.4 C  
CPU Average: 54.5 C  
CPU Min (normal desktop usage): 37.5 C, right after the single core test

Another thing I'd like to ask is that if it's normal for my CPU to have an all-core vcore of around 1.008 volts, while on the single-threaded test it maintained a vcore of around 1.48 volts. However the single-threaded test boosted to \~4.8ghz, the all core only boosted to around 3.74ghz.

I know the 7nm CPUs are running hotter (and can stand higher temperature) than the ""old"" CPUs.  
Therefore I bought the biggest air cooler I was able to get (Dark Rock Pro 4 TPU 250W) because I did not want to go for an AIO. (And I still do not want)  


TLDR:   
Would you be concerned about CPU Temp peak of 90.4°C with a Ryzen 9 5950X during Cinebench R23?  
From what I read 90°C peaks are  high, but not shortening lifetime or damaging the CPU.  


I ran Cinebench R23 and got great scores.  
**Single Core** 1566pts  
\- CPU Max Temperature 75.4°C  
\- Average during Test 63.9°C  
\- Minimum 40.9°C (coming from normal desktop usage)  
\- GPU Temps (Max, Avg, Min): 51.3°C, 41.6°C, 39.4°C  
\- M2 SSD between CPU and Graphic Card around 41°C all time.  


**Multicore** 27488pts  
\- CPU Max Temperature **90.4°C**   
(Thermal Throttling in HWInfo says ""No"" which shall mean it did not throttled it.)  
\- Average during Test 83.1°C  
\- Minimum 47.9°C (coming from the cinebench single core test)  
\- GPU Temps (Max, Avg, Min): 49.3°C, 43.9°C, 42.4°C  
\- M2 SSD between CPU and Graphic Card around 45°C all time.

Corsair RM850 850W PSU  
All together in a Be quiet Pure 500 Midi Tower  
I reach peak temperature of 90.4 Degree Celsius for the CPU with the multicore Test in Cinebench R23  
Thermal Throttling does not kick in as far as i can see from HWinfo.  
The system runs stable, no crashes, no bluescreens. Furmark runs the GPU up to 71°C, while CPU averages around 70°C after peaking to 75°C.  
M2 SSD peaks to 51°C but averages out at 48 (sitting between CPU and Graphiccard)

In general I would leave it as it is.   
No OC (Beside RAM XMP Profile usage), but the 90.4°C peak concerns me a little.  
I expect the PC would throttle or turn off, before the CPU gets too hot.  
I have to say I expected lower temps for CPU with that Dark Rock Pro 4.  
At the same time I read some articles/blog/posts about Ryzen 9 can stand the 90°C peaks without shortened lifetime or any issues.  
So I am looking for input, if I should be more concerned about the temperature peak or not.

1,17,0,1,0,"Just upgraded to a 3600, after 10 yrs on an i7 965, need help understanding temps, voltages &amp; frequenciesHello ! As title said, i've been using an i7 965 for the past 10 years, so not only do i know nothing about AMD cpu's behavior, but my knowledge is also very outdated


I have been monitoring a bit and i noticed vcore varies a lot, going up to even **1.44v**, is this normal? Temps seems to be alright, going up to about **70-75°c under heavy load**, and in the **60s ingame**, while frequencies under heavy load hover around **4.1Ghz all core. I have seen 4.2Ghz happen, even all core, but not during cinebench runs**, i'm not sure why.


I basically have everything in auto in the bios and i just went and **enabled PBO**, which seems to have given me some gain in cinebench, but now it seems to be running at **1.375v and jump between 3.6 and 4.2Ghz IDLE**


I kind of forgot to check if it had a lower voltage &amp; frequencies before turning PBO on. Idle temp with that voltage &amp; freqs hover around 34-38°c with a CM hyper 212 BE



None of it seem very concerning at first glance but i'd rather ask, as i really don't know much except from videos from famous youtubers (GN, Linus, etc)


Oh and i've ran the diagnosis from ""CTR"" but haven't applied anything, i mostly wanted the diagnosis first (which i ran before enabling pbo btw, if that changes anything)

------------------------

Here are the results 


&gt; DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS

&gt; AMD Ryzen 5 3600 6-Core Processor

&gt; CPU VID: 1120

&gt; CPU TEL: 1094

&gt; Max temperature: 60,3°

&gt; Energy efficient: 3,7

&gt; Your CPU is SILVER SAMPLE

&gt; Recomended values for overclocking (P1 profile):

&gt; Reference voltage: 1250 mV

&gt; Reference frequency: 4225 MHz

&gt; Recomended values for overclocking (P2 profile):

&gt; Reference voltage: 1350 mV

&gt; Reference frequency: 4375 MHz

&gt; Recomended values for undervolting:

&gt; Reference voltage: 1175 mV

&gt; Reference frequency: 4075 MHz

------------------------

I have no idea what P1 &amp; P2 are but i have to say, 4375mhz at 1.35v would look a lot more appealing than 3.6-4.2 at 1.375-1.44v


Is there no ""idle state"" kind of thing where the cpu wouldnt run at 1.375 and max boost all core when its doing nothing? Or is this happening because of PBO?

I’ve been a Mac user that whole time.

So when I bought the parts I had my 1yo (7 months at the time) with me, I was running through the parts and had 3400 in my head and not 3600. 

Anyway, I had 32GB of 3200mhz ram. 

I had issue after issue with the ram when I ran it at 3200. 
I’ve got a mortar Max board and everything said it was fine, but BSoD after BSoD at 3200 had me failing it back and then not an issue. 

Fast forward to last week, I found a hood deal on the last of stock on the 3600 at a shop. 

Dropped it in and it was a heap better. 

Then Monday I thought I’ll try the ram at 3200. 
Now I’ve only changed the CPU, nothing else and bang. 
I’ve got it pumping all week, not 1 error, running photoshop, Lightroom, photo booth programs, even gaming. Ram cinebench and got high 9000s, the old CPU I was lucky to get 3000 and that was if I didn’t have a BSoD.

This is only because AMD have not fully fixed their website, you can still check the stock on the site by simply sending a post request ""add to cart"" and retrieving the response as I just did 5 minutes ago

[5800x stock on amd.com\/fr](

Bots like partalert can always instantly know if there is stock or not, now I let you imagine what a guy might do with bad intention, captcha or not

The only thing AMD fixed is the problem with the script that instantly added a graphics card to the cart, the problem with that is that with the script you could grab a GPU as fast as a bot manually (Thanks to the German forum hardwareluxx for sharing the script every week for those in need), now you have to pray so that the ""add to cart"" buttons appear before there is no more card in stock

Recently I been looking at various processers like the i5-8259u and ryzen 5 4500u in search of the best mini-pc / nuc for my sister. And out of curiosity on how they compare to ryzen 7 1800x. 

I have been using this website to compare

where they all seem to be in the same ballpark since according to the ""effective speed"" on those websites, they are almost as good as the 1800x despite being low wattage processors.

But I have to ask are they really that good? 

And if not, what should I look for when comparing processors in order to get an understand of what is better than what?

&amp;#x200B;
