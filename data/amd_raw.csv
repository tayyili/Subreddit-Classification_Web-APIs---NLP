Amd,Do you think AMD has plans to produce more APUs for more handheld gaming PCs?,"Valve engineers have clearly stated interest in having Steam OS available, free to license for any competitors that would like to produce handhelds similar to the Steam Deck. So software-wise, the market definitely has potential to grow. But will AMD distribute APUs to other manufacturers that can perform similarly to the custom-made Valve APU?

There is a big opportunity to grow this market. The OS is readily available. There are other manufacturers making handheld PCs (though they are with Windows, and not Steam OS). AMD could definitely make a killing selling these APUs to other manufacturers. But is it in their plans? This is likely the strongest unknown factor that will impact the growth of the handheld gaming PC market.",False,0,0,1,0

Amd,Showerthought - Buying direct from AMD,"After months of ""add to cart"" and failing consistently and finding cards for sale way above MSRP immediately after on ebay and other similar providers: Why isn't AMD using a similar system to what Valve used for the pre-order of the steam deck. Digital River is not a good 3rd party and if anything it drives people away from AMD. I wish AMD would partner with i.e. valve to guarantee cards reach the hands of gamers. If demand wasn't so high, this would not make sense but, whith demand at this level, they would surely not lose money on cards with this approach.  I believe they already have a good relationship with valve at the corporate level, drafting a framework for this type of service should not be the end of the world IMHO.  u/AMD_robert",False,0,0,1,0

Amd,Why is my memory bandwidth low?,"TL/DR: Why does HWiNFO64 report maximum DRAM Read Bandwidth of only 9.7 Gbps? RAM is rated for 28800 MB/s (225 Gbps?) peak transfer rate. Why is my actual bandwidth so low?

R7 3700x on MSI B550 Tomahawk A7 BIOS and DDR4-3600C16 RAM.  XMP profile activated. HWiNFO reports it's operating in dual channel mode @ 1800 MHz.

I noticed a new feature in HWiNFO 7.06 that reports the DRAM Read and Write bandwidth.  During a video encode (x265), I noticed the read bandwidth is low vs. the peak speed of the RAM.  If I've done my math right, it's about 4.3% of the rated speed.  ""Current"" is way slower than ""maximum"" - &lt; 4 Gbps.

The write bandwidth is even slower. ""Maximum"" is 0.347 Gbps.

A Prime95 stress test got the maximum DRAM bandwidth up to 15 Gbps, but well short of rated.

I assume writing would be slower because of the DRAM refresh cycle.  But writing at 3.5% of the bandwidth of reading?  And reading at 4.3% of the peak rated speed?

* Bug in HWiNFO?
* Bug in the MSI A7 BIOS?
* Defective RAM/MB/Processor? (Some time ago I did a Prime95 stress test for a few hours and I've never blue-screened, so I'd be surprised at this).

Amd,Guide to Undervolting Ryzen Mobile processors as of July 2021,"I have had 2 laptops now running the ryzen mobile platform, and have been thoroughly dissapointed with AMD's software support of their own CPU's, they perform pretty bad with the stock voltages and boost, mostly due to extreme thermals.

&amp;#x200B;

This could be said about intel CPU's as well as any processor running boost will programmatically keep boosting until they hit a power and / or thermal throttle, the difference being that intel mobile chips can be undervolted for the most part, many manufacturers locked down this ability but this can be undone by simply downloading older bios versions.

&amp;#x200B;

You cannot use Ryzen Master on the mobile platform currently, and i have yet to see a full-on overclock and processor control utility thus far for Ryzen mobile, the closest thing we have currently is [AMD APU Tuning Utility](https://www.techspot.com/downloads/7387-amd-apu-tuning-utility.html)

&amp;#x200B;

The program is great but it fails to provide the single most important control for overclockers - Voltage control.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a little program that isn't too well know and is misunderstood regarding how to use it by many which does actually allow you to lock core clocks down on all cores and set a constant voltage on most, if not all Ryzen mobile chips - 

&amp;#x200B;

[Helles Ryzen Test](https://github.com/NinjaGaurav/RyzenTest)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this program isn't perfect and doesn't provide as many features as throttlestop or Intel XTU / Ryzen Master, but it does allow Voltage control, and can drastically improve your performance and temps while under load.

I have tested this program on a Ryzen 3750h and a Ryzen 3250u thus far and it works on both. It carries minimal risk and in worst case scenarios will crash your PC, but is fine after rebooting if the undervolt / clock is unstable.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the steps i use to OC / Undervolt my Mobile CPU's -

&amp;#x200B;

* Open Windows Power options, Go to processor power management, and set the following settings to these values :

1. ""Allow Throttle States"" = Disabled
2. ""Processor Performance Boost Policy"" -  0%
3. ""Processor Performance Boost Mode"" - Disabled
4. ""Minimum Processor State"" - 98%
5. ""Maximum Processor State"" - 99%

The reason we are locking the pstate betweeen 98-99%, is because this forces the processor to use the P1 state which can be freely modified in Ryzen Test, modifying P0 causes crashes instantly.

&amp;#x200B;

* Download and extract [Helles Ryzen Test](https://github.com/NinjaGaurav/RyzenTest), then go to the folder to which you extracted the contents
* Right-click ""RyzenTest0.exe"", and go to properties, then navigate to the ""Compatibility"" tab, and check the box that says ""Run this program as an administrator""
* Click Apply / Ok, then run ""RyzenTest0.exe"", not the regular ""RyzenTest"", only the one that says ""RyzenTest0.exe"", a screen should pop up that looks like this, the values for clock and voltage will vary depending on CPU, note that i already have my p1 state set here - 

https://preview.redd.it/l2yvjlc0t1e71.png?width=282&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e20aec7e7ad44ef67501bfc9be5ffc7f925686c

&amp;#x200B;

* Take a note on the exact values OF FID, DID, and VID In your P0 state and write them down, screenshot or type in notepad.
* Press the Up arrow next to ""Select P-State (p0-p2)"", this will allow you to modify the P1 state that your CPU is locked to now.
* Now that the P1 state is selected, first thing to do is to copy the DID value from the P0 state (middle slider bar), this is important because this modifies the FID (Frequency)
* Now change the value of the FID and VID to the ones you have in your P0 state
* Press ""YES"" in the bottom left corner, and check CPU-Z, If you did everything properly your processor should be running at its max advertised clock speed and voltage consistently and won't boost or downlclock
* This is where you can tinker around with your clock speeds (FID) and voltage (VID), My Ryzen 3750h runs very stable locked at 3.6 ghz (144 FID) with the VID Down to 120 (0.80v), i could probably go lower but haven't yet. you will have to run a decent bit of trial and error to find th sweetspot for your processor.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If your computer crashes or it doesn't work, try to run ""InstWinRing0.exe"" as an administrator, this is located in the same folder as RyzenTest0, reboot, and run RyzenTest0 again.

This program needs to be started every time you boot windows or the changes will not re-apply.

Amd,"A year later, the problems still continue. ( RX 5600 XT crashes, need help )","Hello everyone I hope you're all doing good.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2020 I built a full AMD computer ( R5 3600 and RX 5600 XT ).

&amp;#x200B;

I hoped that with driver updates my graphics card would stop crashing Windows but it didn't. Most people say that the system failures and stuff have been fixed some time ago ( I believe it was in drivers version 20.9.1 ).

&amp;#x200B;

Through out all the time I've used this gpu I've had and still have 3 different problems. When I first bought the card I used to get bluescreen, then some time later with some driver updates I started having blackscreens and now, in the present, the screen just freezes on whatever I'm doing I can still hear the things on the background but I don't have any control on my PC, I can't move nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Apart from that, drivers still fail sometime I'm just watching a video on youtube or something and the screen suddendly turns black and then it turns back on saying that the driver failed, this is not that bad but I'm quite annoyed with the systems hangs.

&amp;#x200B;

Windows usually crashes when I'm doing less intensive stuff, as an example it crashes quite easily on Stardew Valley but a game that is a bit more intensive it is really really rare to crash.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly don't know what to do more I've tried DDUing the drivers many times, I've installed the drivers without the adrenaline software but nothing seems to work.

&amp;#x200B;

If you know of something I could try or a potencial fix please comment.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading.

Amd,5950x WHEA Error and Random Restart Fix,"Just wanted to share this for others to try before going down the RMA route.

If you're getting random reboots with your 5950x with no BSOD or error dumps, and only getting event viewer logs such as:

\- Kernel Power 41  
\- WHEA 18 Machine Check Exception / Cache Hierarchy Error / APIC ID: x

Try installing AMD Ryzen Master, and then click on Auto OC and apply. This fixed the reboot issues for me and I now have a stable system that has been running for 4 days with no restarts.

I don't know yet why this works I assume it must be a specific BIOS setting. My setup is:  
\- Ryzen 9 5950x  
\- ROG Crosshair VIII Dark Hero  
\- MSI Suprim x 3080Ti  
\- Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro SL 64GB (4x 16)  
\- Dark Power Pro 12 (1200W)  
\- OS installed on Samsung 970 and Samsung 960 for data

With all Windows Updates installed, latest AMD chipset, and latest BIOS version (3601) I would get random restarts several times a day, like sudden losses of power. Regardless of the system being under load or at idle. With auto restarts disabled there was no BSOD and the dump file wasn't written to at all.

I tested the RAM, Hard Drives, GPU and PSU separately and they all ran fine. I also ran all OCCT tests and everything passed.

I tried multiple BIOS configurations. SVM off, PBO, CPB and DOCP set to Auto, Enabled and Disabled. None of this made any difference to the restarts.

I then set DOCP, PBO and CPB to enabled, installed AMD Ryzen Master and set it to Auto OC. Since doing this I haven't had a single restart.

I am still wondering if I should RMA. IMO The processor should be stable at default.",False,0,0,1,0

Amd,AMD BEATS!... BUT THERE IS SOMETHING SERIOUSLY WRONG!,"Dear READERS,

AMD reported Q2 earnings yesterday...

Revenue is UP 99% year over year. EARNINGS up 352% ($0.54 cents expectations, $0.63 DELIVERED).

It beat expectations on GUIDANCE for next quarter ($4.1bn guidance vs $3.8 expectations).

In short, trifecta BEAT: REVENUE/EARNINGS/GUIDANCE

They reported buying 3.2 million shares back during Q2 (from their $4bn buy-back program).

The 3.2 million shares were bought for $256 million (at $80 per share).

....AND they have $3.8 billion in CASH, which means THEY ARE HAPPY TO BUY MORE!

AMD has business with GOOGLE, AMAZON, TESLA, MICROSOFT, SONY, SAMSUNG, VALVE, etc.

AMD has business with Google, AMAZON, TESLA, SONY, MICROSOFT and SAMSUNG

But.... there is SOMETHING SERIOUSLY wrong with AMD

As Don Clark tweeted yesterday (assistant news editor of the WSJ with over 40 years in the tech sector).

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/twitter.com\/donal888\/status\/1420117004673900546](https://preview.redd.it/x6qevw7jwxd71.jpg?width=626&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de45dc3a60002a9a920bcb0c54ff3f20fecaf7bf)

https://twitter.com/donal888/status/1420117004673900546

What is WRONG?... Simple: **SOME PEOPLE HATE IT.**

These individuals are commonly known as ""Shintels"" or ""Nvidiots"".

They hate AMD as they have competitive products, making some purchases seem stupid.

This may also explain why NVIDIA is trading at over TWICE the P/E of AMD...

NVIDIA has business with Nintendo. Forget about Sony, Microsoft, Samsung, etc.

**But I have an even better example, involving REDDIT**

I've been reporting on AMD for over 3 months.

My articles on this platform were recently banned. My profile was temporally blocked.

The arguments were ridiculous. Namely that I was **advertising** youtube content creators in my posts, as I included sources to my conclusions and analysis with links.

Think about it!.... I include sources to my posts and I am accused of advertising.

Advertising involves **PAYMENT**... and I got NOTHING to post my articles.

Not by the youtube tech analysts I quoted, not by anyone else.

**I basically got blamed for providing evidence to my arguments.**

Ridiculous arguments and excuses to support my posts being blocked.

&amp;#x200B;

I've studied LAW... which is HARD. Yet anyone can be an admin and censor with baseless grounds.

Studying  law is no easy feat. Understanding constitutional law, including our  very first amendment of the US Constitution, can easily distinguish the  notion of freedom of expression and advertising.

Yet,  those who consider themselves ""Bosses"", without the slightest knowledge  or understand of the law think otherwise. And they seem pretty  confident with their ignorance.

# Congrats AMD on the Q2 results.

Amd,Can a Ryzen 5 4600G and Radeon Vega 7 Graphics handle MSFS2020?,"Hello! I was planning on buying a new desktop that has an AMD Ryzen 5 4600G and AMD Radeon Vega 7 Graphics. I don't really have the money to buy a computer that costs something like $1,000, so I settled off with that desktop I found.

I wanted that desktop for things like school work (yes the new school year is coming so I need a new computer), but also for stuff like gaming, most specifically, MSFS2020. But I am still not sure if the new desktop I want can handle MSFS2020, and my old PC cannot handle most games because it only has 4gb of RAM and an Intel Celeron J1800 processor.

So here I am, asking if a desktop with an AMD Ryzen 5 4600G and AMD Radeon Vega 7 Graphics can handle MSFS2020.

(Oh yeah and here is the link to the desktop I wanted: [https://www.amazon.com/Acer-TC-391-UR12-Hexa-Core-Processor-Graphics/dp/B08Y642KLC/ref=pd\_lpo\_2?pd\_rd\_i=B08Y642KLC&amp;th=1](https://www.amazon.com/Acer-TC-391-UR12-Hexa-Core-Processor-Graphics/dp/B08Y642KLC/ref=pd_lpo_2?pd_rd_i=B08Y642KLC&amp;th=1))",False,10,0,1,0

Amd,Diagnosing a Bad Core,"I have a new 5950x processor that I was planning on overclocking using PBO2 curve optimization. Before I started doing anything, I wanted a baseline so I completely reset the CMOS and, following the guide here ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/krxqq4/5950x\_curve\_optimizer\_settings\_and\_benchmarks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/krxqq4/5950x_curve_optimizer_settings_and_benchmarks/)), ran the stated stability test. 

To recap, the test is prime95 using a single worker pinned to a single CPU core using large FFTs and disabling all AVX instructions.

Unfortunately I get a failure of this test, sometimes after around half an hour sometimes almost instantly, when I run it on Core 1 which is my ""best"" core according to hwinfo and ryzen master. Spot checking other cores including my second best, I can run for several hours before manually stopping the worker: so no failures. 

The actual error message is ""rounding was 0.5 expecting less than 0.4"".

Do you guys think I have a bad core on this processor and can you think of anything else I can do to try to diagnose it? Again this is a completely cleared CMOS so no overclocking, no overvolting, RAM at JEDEC, etc.  I don't think it's the RAM because I ran memtestx86 overnight and it passed everything, and I also kind of doubt it's the motherboard because then other cores would fail as well, but I'm looking for more ideas of possible before I start the RMA process with AMD.",False,1,0,1,0
Amd,Was thinking of changing to AMD,"I have a i5 6600k and a 1060 6gb. Its been punching its weight, but It's leaving me wanting a lot more with the architectural rendering and more complex 3d modelling that I do. I also game whenever I get the time.

I was thinking of switching to a 5800x at 600 aud or 5600x for 400 aud, or stay in intel with a i9 10900KF at 600. Either way I have to change motherboards, replace the 5 year old power supply, and get 32gb ram or something from the 8gb 2666mhz I have. Overall it's approximately its a 900-1000 usd upgrade. I don't want to change my gpu as even someone less knowledgeable with this can see how much of a rip off it is right now.

The intel option of a 10900kf has 10 cores and 20 threads, but I still see people say a 5800x is better?

I'm not too knowledgeable about this, but my main question is how drastic of a change is the 5600x from the 5800x in terms of non-gaming usage like what I do? Is the 5800x worth the 200 dollars? (147 usd).

Amd,Ryzen 5600 OC Curve Optimizer + Increase Power limits?!,"Hello guys,

just getting a bit into OC at all. I try to get the best performance out of my 5600x.

At first i did PBO on advanced, PBO Limits disabled and then went into curve optimizer and put 30 negative in. Tried with Prime85 and Warzone. Worked stable and with higher boost clock then bevor. Getting more points in 3D Mark for CPU. Also the temps etc. everything is looking really good.

&amp;#x200B;

Also tried a bit with the override and was able to get 4,8GhZ Boost clock. 

&amp;#x200B;

If im right then what happens is that die CPU boost up to 4,8 for example and then run into the power limit of 75W. There it stops. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question now is... What if i did like bevor but also increase power limit. Would the CPU be able to boost even higher? Is there experience about that? What Power Limit is ""safe""? And where in Bios would i set them? Is it just under PBO Limits -&gt; Manual?

Amd,Should I upgrade from 1700 to 5600X or better?,"So I've had my trusty 1700 since pretty much the beginning. It has certainly served me very well and still does a great job to this day. But in Feb I got myself a 3070, which was a hell of an upgrade over the 970 I had for like 5 years or so. 

Obviously there is now a bottleneck, though not necessarily a very obvious one. The only one I think this would be huge is Ark as I noticed that I had barely any performance increase in large bases between the 970 and the 3070.

Anyway, I've been wanting to upgrade for a while but I was always thinking ""what if Zen 4 comes out sooner rather than later"" but now looking at the even more recent news I can see it is still a while away. On top of that I now know it will likely be DDR5 too, which not only means I'd need new RAM but also means it will be expensive as all hell (I remember the move to DDR3 &amp; 4). 

So I guess I just want to have my thoughts validated. At this point, it's probably best to just get the best latest Ryzen I can afford, right? But then I feel like if I deal with the non-perfect performance for a while longer, I could instead start on a new generation instead of having to upgrade twice (since I will have to get a new MB since 1700 MB won't support the latest Zens).

But will the performance of Zen 4 be a significant increase over 5600x et al? No one knows I guess.

Sorry to blabber, I guess I just need someone to re-affirm that I should just upgrade to the best I can afford now and maybe wait for 2nd gen Zen 4 once any kinks are ironed out + prices settle a bit.

My  question is which one should I keep. Since the 6700xt has 12gb of VRAM I  feel like it is a bit more powerful and also future proof. But on the  other hand the difference might not be so big and the 3060ti is a bit  better for streaming because of the encoder that Nvidia GPUs have.

I'm conflicted and can use some help deciding on which CPU to get. If all else being equal, which is a better CPU: Ryzen 7 3750H (4C/8T/2.3) or Ryzen 3 Pro 4350G (4C/8T/3.8)?

I'm assuming 4350G is Zen 2 while 3750H is a previous generation? Both have the same number of cores and threads, and the single core turbo speed is the same at 4.0 GHz; although the 4350 appears to be able to run all the cores at 4.0 under load while the 3750H can't?

Is the Radeon 6 on the 4350G is a weaker GPU than the Vega 10? Fundamentally are they on the same graphics architecture so generally the higher frequency and more shader count a chip has the more data processing it can handle?

Amd,5800X: Curve Optimizer v.s. manual undervolt?,"I'm trying to get my temps on my 5800X as low as possible. Out of the box my MSI B550 board was supplying the cpu with like 1.4V all core which seemed like way too much for stock speed, so I manually set the voltage to 1.2V. Unfortunately the only way to manually set the voltage is if you manually set the clock speed as well, which seems to get the CPU out of P-state and just lock on to whatever frequency you set. At ""auto"" speed and voltage it was boosting to the advertised 4.7 GHz under full load with max temp of 80C (I have an NH-D15 btw). In order to get that same performance with manual undervolt to 1.2V, I had to set the clock speed at 4.7 where it stays locked all the time. The max temp under load is now 72C and is around 10C cooler while gaming. I know that a lot of people say PBO + CO is the ""right"" way to overclock a Ryzen CPU but I really don't care about going far beyond  4.7 GHz. Anyways I also tried using the curve optimizer with a -30 voltage offset on all cores and it seems to be stable in benchmarks, however the temps are the same as stock under load, just the CPU is running faster, which makes sense given how curve optimizer works. In gaming the temps are slightly better than stock (50-60C with CO, 55-65 without) but nowhere near with manual overclock (40-50). So I guess my question is: Is it ""healthy"" for the system to run at this locked voltage and clock speed, or should I just accept slightly higher temps and set everything at auto except the curve optimizer? I'm really new to this so any help is appreciated.",False,6,0,1,0

Amd,"If you're a laptop owner, ALWAYS prefer drivers from the manufacturer's website for both igpu, dedicated GPU. Here's why.","And obviously chipset drivers.

All these days I've been gaming on my igpu without even realizing it cause I had idpu drivers from amd website, Nvidia drivers from Nvidia's website.

But then after a month, I felt that something is off with how my games look and when I researched about drivers, among hundreds of ""it's OK you're fine with drivers from amd and Nvidia"", there were few gems that explained that, for laptops, we need to have drivers from the manufacturer's website for igpu and GPU to talk to each other.

It basically means that all of my apps and games were running on igpu the whole time eventhough it looked like my GPU was working hard. Now with basically after deleting all the drivers and installing all the drivers from the Acer website, it was a shocker. All the new details, ray tracing stuff, the textures and what not, everything popped up now which I didn't even know exist before.

Not just that, resizing a window, windows search popping up, making a YouTube video full screen and many such little things are way smoother now. The load is actually being shared by both CPU and GPU now.

If you haven't tried it and you know what you're doing, I woukd strongly recommend shifting to OEM drivers from either AMD or Nvidia website's.",False,5,0,1,0

Amd,Advice on which Ryzen CPU to get for a Build,"So essentially my teenage brother has been moaning recently that his 4-year old mid-range PC is starting to get a little slow. So I decided to try and win much older brother of the year award by getting him a PC for his birthday.

In essence, I'm basically putting a PC together based on parts I've replaced from my old PC over the years (effectively he gets my old 1080 Ti, 650W PSU, air cooler, case, and 3000MHz RAM) though I was planning to buy the motherboard and CPU new because I don't think a Z270 and i5-7600K would have much longevity.

Now original plan was to buy a new B550 and 3700x for his build. However (without humble bragging too much) I recently I got a substantial pay rise and I thought ""hey why don't I treat myself in the process"". So I started looking at Zen 3 CPUs with the idea of getting a Zen 3 for myself and then giving my brother the (just one year old) 3700x currently in my machine.

Now I'm reading around and it seems 5800x would be the best candidate for an upgrade but there are a few things throwing me off:

1) Lots of talk of it not being good value for money - though looking around it seems 5600x is just a sidegrade (at which point I should just stick to the original plan of just buying a new 3700x for my brother), the 5800x is selling for £350, whilst the 5900x is £500. So I'm just checking if this con disappeared at some point?

2) I'm slightly concerned by the reports about the thermals of the 5800x. My current 3700x pushes to 72C currently with my H115i Pro cooler and not helped by my 3080 FE having pushed up the case temperatures a bit.

Now I do mostly play games for the CPU stretching task, but one of the games is Total War: Warhammer 2 which I've noticed does benefit quite a bit from the Zen 3 single core performance boost.

So my question is should I be financially sensible and just stick to the original plan of getting a new 3700x or give myself a 5800x upgrade?",False,27,0,1,0

Amd,Help a noob overclock Ryzen 5 3600,"Hi! I know some topics about ryzen 5 3600 have already been talked about, but I can't find anywhere some straight answers and info. I don't know much about overclocking so sorry if I mistook some things, I'm trying to do this because if I leave it as it is the temps are moving up and down from \~35 to 55c just by moving the cursor on desktop. I have a ryzen 5 3600 with a scythe mugen 5 revb cooler, tried to overclock it a few times with ryzen master, i'll add some pictures from my tests. Overall I get idle temps somewhere around 37-45c, in tests like cinebench and aida i get temps from 70 to 85 max, all of these after I set 4300 on all cores and 1.3125 voltage in ryzen master. I'll end up setting 4200 with 1.218v because i get lower max temps, but my questions are:

If I leave those settings like this, is it safe? 

Should I set those setting in bios and get rid of ryzen master? It seems like it's resetting everytime I reboot.

The voltage will stay permanently set at 1.3125 for example or it will vary depending by use and it will hit that max voltage at full usage? I'm asking this because in HWinfo I see the values are fixed, but in ryzen master clocks and voltage change by usage of pc.

How should I set precision boost overdrive in bios? If I leave it on enable or disabled, in ryzen master I see something like 90-100% of 120A at EDC, but if I leave it at advanced, I get like 60-70% of 120A EDC with the same scores in cinebench and temps.

Is it worth it to try to overclock my ram? I have two different brand sticks but with the same specs, 2x8gb 2133mhz cl15.

Amd,"RX6900XT or 7k 8k + VR Videos, possible ?"," 

hi guys,  
So apparently I got some documentary\* 8k VR videos that I watch in VR using a RX6900XT + an Oculus rift S

The RX 6900 XT is a gaming-beast, no doubt, the only thing is when playing VR videos of 7k 8k or above it seems to struggle ? I'm not sure if it's because of the software or the limitation of the GPU itself ?

When I use my old 2080ti, everything is fine even 8k VR is smooth. But on 6900 XT, 7K 8K video is laggy, stutter, unwatchable, … but lower resolution 6k 5k 4k seems fine.

It's worth noting that with the 6900xt, when I play those 8k videos Flat on desktop using VLC player, it's also laggy, only when I use a player called 5kplayer, everything is smooth.

My setup:

CPU 5600x

RAM 32gb 3200

SSD: Sn750 1 TB

GPU: RX 6900XT

VR head set: Oculus rift S (with newest Oculus drivers)

Software: on Oculus software: deovrplayer, gizmovideoplayer,... steamVR: deovrplayer, gizmo videoplayers....

So I'm wondering if anyone is experiencing the same problem?",False,28,0,1,0

Amd,Need help for overclocking. MSI x570 Unify + 5900X,"Good day, brothers and sisters. I have a problem. I am very bad at overclocking, so I ask for your advice. Before swearing at me, I must say that before writing this post, I watched \~20 videos on YouTube and none were useful to me. ( Of course, I tried the advice I heard there in practice )

So I'll start over and try not to take a lot of your time.

Yesterday I finally replaced my faithful friend from 2013 (old PC)

At the moment my system is:

1. MSI x570 Unify ( last BIOS verison, not BETA )
2. Ryzen 5900X with AMD site chipset driver, rest from MSI site
3. CRUCIAL Ballistix Black DDR4 3600MHz 4x16GB (CL 16-18-18-38)
4. Be quite Silent base 802
5. Arctic liquid freezer 360 rev. 4
6. MSI 980 ti - ye ROFL, but this is workstation ;)
7. SSD Samsung 980 Pro 1Tb
8. PSU Be Quite 1000 Platinum

So. For some strange reason, the completely default BIOS settings ( u can see a screen ) give me a better overclocking + temperature results than any of the 20+ manuals.

1.1 [https://i.gyazo.com/a11b896b4e12b94dbed23615a5568d4e.png](https://i.gyazo.com/a11b896b4e12b94dbed23615a5568d4e.png)

1.1  This suits me, since the values+temps ​​are very good i guess. But according to simple logic, automatic OC cannot be better than manual tuning, or something has changed in 8 years ??? 

Last what ill trying on this system after &gt; Load default settings and enable XPM 1

1. Advanced CPU Configuration &gt; AMD Overclocking &gt; Precision Boot Overdrive ( Disable &gt; Advanced )
2.  PBO limits ( Auto &gt; Disabled )
3.  Curve optimizer ( Disabled &gt; All cores )
4.  All Core Curve Optimizer Sing ( Positive &gt; Negative )
5.  All Core Curve Optimizer Magnitude ( 0 &gt; ill try 30, 20 )  
PC will auto-reboot after \~30sec-1min on Windows idle loading...  
Any idea what overclocking values ​​to try to get the best profit  ?

I just dusted off a Vega 64 FE, it was purchased with air cooling but I added a EKWB block to it.

I've recently got back into Windows gaming and the Vega is still my fastest card.

I want to get the maximum performance out of it, what are the steps to take nowadays?

The game motivating me right now is Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 on Oculus CV1.

I see lots of posts from 2+ years ago but obviously nothing recent because a lot of people have moved on.  I see broken ""switch driver mode"" options, registry hacks, adrenalin drivers.  All I know is my ""performance"" settings only have the ""non existent"" fan settings, nothing about clocks...

It's still a decent card and the whole crypto coin price rort with video cards means I'm not going to buy something faster.

Amd,"What is the point of having 128 PCIe lanes on the Threadripper PRO, storage wise","I'm in charge of a large fleet of powerful workstations and I'm considering trying the Threadripper PRO hardware, but I don't understand its storage capacities.

The Threadripper PRO motherboards:

-Asus Pro WS WRX80E-SAGE SE WIFI
-Gigabyte WRX80-SU8-IPMI
-The one integrated in the Lenovo ThinkStation P620 workstation
-Supermicro M12SWA-TF

have few integrated storage slots and connectors, and they are focused on SATA and SAS. 

Both SATA and SAS protocols are slow for the highest end workstation of today, they were outclassed by NVMe M.2 devices, so I think they are present for compatibility purposes.

So if you want actual speedy storage, you are limited to either 2 or 3 M.2 slots. And if you want actual speedy storage in a relevant amount, you need to use the PCIe expansion slots. 

BUT, the hardware for ""NVMe M.2 to PCIe"" adapters in the desktop (as in ""not server"") is limited, as far as I know, to:

a) Asus Hyper M.2 X16 Gen 4 Card, with mixed opinions on its reliability even when using only one (I doubt populating 5 or 6 of these, with each one holding 4 M.2 devices would keep working 24x7 for months)

b) Dubious Aliexpress grade devices, limited to holding only 1 or 2 M.2 devices because they are still PCIe 3.0 .


It seems that all the reliable ""NVMe M.2 to PCIe"" adapters were designed for a rack mounted server and not for an ATX motherboard. It makes sense because the Threadripper PRO line are basically EPYC CPUs.

But, since Intel still owns the server market due to it's shady business practices and they aren't interested in PCIe 4.0 , I don't think there is even a server grade PCIe 4.0 adapter (it might be, I didn't check Dell and so because even if there is, it wouldn't work in this form factor)

Given this situation:

-Can you actually use the PCIe expansion slots for storage? Or the 128 PCIe lanes for that matter?

-Are you limited to use a Fibre Channel device adapter, connected through fibre cables to a external datacenter grade array? ... in a workstation hardware?

-If you are limited to Fibre Channel for actual speedy storage in a relevant amount, then what are the 128 PCIe lanes for? Just for stuffing 7 graphic cards?

Amd,Threadripper appropriate for my workload?,"Hi,

Currently, I work as a software developer who is feeling the pain of slow compile times and my PC being near-unusable while doing so. I also do a lot of virtualization which doesn't scale well on my current 8-core Intel CPU.

I guess that begs the question - is Threadripper the better option in this use case? If there is any other software developer that has made the jump, sharing your experiences would be awesome.

I do also have a few other questions when it comes to Threadripper and AMD in general:

* If I do decide to go with Threadripper, is it worth waiting for the Zen 3 Threadrippers?
* Unfortunately, I still have a few tasks that can still only be ran on a single core. How bad is Threadripppers single core performance on the 32/64 core count SKU currently compared to high-end Ryzen?
* I know gaming isn't the primary purpose of Threadripper, but I do wish to know what hoops I might have to jump through if I wanted to run current AAA games on it and what performance is like. If possible, I'd rather not build 2 separate PCs for work and personal use.
* How good is AMD's low-level debugging and profiling tools? I am quite used to VTune currently and would like to know the differences/limitations compared to AMD's uProf.

I installed the latest chipset drivers and BIOS version. My scores are pretty solid (28209 for R23), so I'm basically happy with the performance, just would love to bring down the temps if at all possible.

I've got a Dark Rock Pro 4, ASUS Tuf Gaming X570-Plus WiFi, and 4 case fans. I recently replaced my Corsair H100i because it was hitting closer to 89 C. I mean, should I return the DRP4 and opt for a Noctua DH-15 or a serious AIO?

I've seen people with similar setups' results better, hovering closer to 75-ish under load. Wondering if I'm doing something wrong or if any settings are conflicting, etc.

So I have a 5950x and Dark Hero. To go with it, I thought the higher the better. It's my first build usually I've just bought machines pre-built, I haven't done an actual build since probably like 18 years (I'm only 35 lol) So I just bought the 4000Mhz Force Xtreem  (actually got it delivered) and thought the higher the better but checking online before opening (not sure why I didn't do it before) but people have been struggling with 4000mhz and getting it stable, whatever that means. 

Initially I bought the 3600Mhz CL14 Force Xtreem which was like way overpriced so I canceled it (yeah I did a bit of research about timings but didn't understand much) so now I might have to return this ram and get the 3600. 

If anyone else has other recommendations like the Neos, or Corsairs then it's fine. I don't mind spending upto £500 but want the best possible ram. 

Without editing, I'm usually just working and I tend to leave my tabs open yeah some of them I keep open and forget about them like I'm reading something so not sure why but my habit is costing me like 3-5GB in memory.

I have a 5900x and a x570 Dark Hero MB. 

From research I understand that the Memory IC will perform best in a dual rank setup (4xSingle Rank DIMMS, 2 x Dual Rank DIMMs)

I also understand that my board is Daisy Chain Vs T-Topology for Memory, and that Daisy Chain performs best with 2 DIMMs.  

I am aiming for 1900 IF OC w/ 32GB of 3800Mhz RAM with as tight timing as I can get (c16 1T).

I understand that Samsung B-Die and Micron E-Die are the best chances at making this possible. 

Now here is my dilemma, aesthetically I am making a blackout build and need black heat spreader RAM (non rgb) and I am having an incredibly difficult time finding Dual Rank 16Gig sticks in either chip type that aren't &gt; $300.

I have found the following two kits

BL2K8G36C16U4B Crucial Ballistix (Micron E-Die) 2 x 8G Single Rank Dimm @ 3600 C16 $93

PVB416G400C9K Patriot Viper Blackout (Samsung B-Die) 2 x 8G Single Rank Dimm @ 4000 C19 $123

1. If I chose 2 of either of the previously mentioned kits for 4 x 8G Single Ranks is the chance to hit my target OC dramatically smaller?
2. Outside of the OC, how much of a performance hit will be seen with a Daisy Chain memory topology with 4 sticks?
3. Is it worth the extra $100 to just buy this kit  F4-3600C14D-32GVK G-Skill Ripjaws V 2 x 16GB Dual Rank @ 3600 Mhz C14 (Samsung B-Die)

Amd,Lower AMD GPU idle power consumption on 144Hz or WQHD or else monitors," 

Heyho Gamers and ecologically conscious people,

if you're like me, you want to have your GPU as cool as possible with the lowest temparature avaiable... At least on idle.

Meanwhile, having a montior which supports everything besides 1080p 60Hz (for example running on WQHD 144Hz) issues a fully occupied memory and following from this a higher power consumption (33 Watt on idle on my RX5700 XT) and temparature.

To fix this, we will go into our beloved AMD Radeon Software. Then, go to Options --&gt; Display. In there we want to create a new custom resolution with all the same as usual but setting the ""Timing-Standard"" to ""CVT-reduced utilization"" (translation may vary - I'm using the german version). After applying these settings your power consumption will go sub 10Watts. If needed, I will post some screenshots in here.

DISCLAIMER: If u follow these steps and there is something like ""this setting is not avaiable for your display"", this could depent on your used cable (HDMI or DP). By my on own experience i can tell, that using DP fixes this issue.

I hope I could help some people out :)

Greetings,  
Maxlo",False,41,0,1,0

It's  restarted a few times on me now. That's on me. Recommended PSU is 850W.  Thought I could fly under the radar due to low power draw of other  components.

So tomorrow arrives my  Seasonic Focus GX-1000w 80+ Gold PSU. Should I anticipate any problems  with this PSU for the reference 6900xt? I know it's 150W over  recommended but just hoping it's a decent PSU spec wise to mitigate this  issue with 6900xt reference cards. I \[now\] know in Linus's review he  had to swap out his 1000w for a 1300w to avoid the spikes tripping his  rig (which is insane BTW). Thanks.

Amd,Testing 5900X with Der8auer's AIO Bracket,"I bought this as kind of whim, and didn't see any Zen3/5000 Series benchmarking on it so I thought what the hell!

Specs:

* 5900X
* Corsair H115i Platinum AIO  2x 140 MM ML fans set at 1200 RPM - Pump at Extreme
* Ambient Temp 25 C (Texas Summers, yay!)
* Noctua NT-H1 TIM
* 9.5 mm Top Y offset, 8.6 mm bottom Y offset, no X offset

I replaced the TIM first to ensure my numbers weren't impacted by older TIM, let the machine idle for 10+ minutes to cool down, then ran 10 min CB23 to start and heat things up.  I did not close out all my background apps as I wanted to see how this would change daily use temps and benchmark tests. 

&amp;#x200B;

|Benchmark|Normal Score|Der8auer Score|Normal Temp/Delta|Der8auer Temp/Delta|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Idle|N/A|N/A|47C/22C|42C/17C|
|CB23|22137|22366|87C/62C|85C/60C|
|P95 Blend (5 min)|N/A|N/A|78C/53C|67C/42C|
|3D Mark CPU test|965-11007|968-10981|85C/60C|78C/53C|
|CIV 6 GS AI Test|28.96|28.79|77C/52C|73C/48C|

Some tests had pretty wild differences, where others were close to the same.  Boost clocks were on average 50-75 Mhz higher, and items with scores are pretty much within the margin of error. 

So is it worth it? I dunno.  It was fun to play with, but I'm not sure I saw any kind of improvement with it except idle temps. Maybe YMMV?",False,7,0,1,0

On the other side full all core load with Cinemabench was yielding only 12 degree difference (high sixties / lower seventies). This couldn't be right - so I've checked my cooler mounting and paste but it was fine so I've stared to look for the cause elsewhere. What caught my attention was the fact that both CCUs temp were around 30-40 degree while Tdie temp was sitting above 60. The next thing which caught my attention was SOC Voltage (in HWInfo) being shown as 1.85 which is far much higher then anything I've ever seen on Ryzen Calculator screenshoots from internet.    


Going into the bios and into tweaker tab welcomed me with 1.2V max SOC voltage. Settting this manually to 1.05 Volts resulted in a MASSIVE drop in CPU temp.  I think I remember Buldozoid noticing this in one of his videos however he has checked the actual SOC voltage in a different tab and sad that this is probably an error in bios.

A few my thoughts: at 4K FSR Performance mode image in motion starts to flicker and shimmer very noticable, it can't be seen on screenshots. Most of the people consider FSR for use on old GPU's (GTX 900/1000 and RX 400/500 series) and using 1080p resolution. FSR at 1080p even at ultra quality mode is suffering from loosing image detail (do not confuse with blurryness) and it is noticable even at medium distance.",False,134,0,1,0

Amd,DLSS Performance Overhead Causes FSR To Have Similar Performance At Higher Internal Resolutions (1440p vs 1620p),"FSR does have worse upsampling that's a fact but because it doesn't rely on machine learning &amp; AI it is much more performant than DLSS so you can use a higher internal resolution for GREATER performance which means although the upscampling is worse it looks comparable due to the higher resolution however this advantage has not been compared at 1080p or 1440p yet in a side by side, so we will have to wait to see if it holds up. I know a post regarding the recent comparisons was already made here but I wanted to share these two things: Firstly this discussion and second share the comparison slider image I made for a better view than a youtube video

I have read that this is normal and per AMD specifications, but it still seemed too hot and I wanted to reduce it if possible without a noticeable performance loss, especially since my CPU wasn't even being fully utilized \~75%. I've been playing around with PBO and the curve optimizer, but whether I enable or disable PBO, curve optimizer down to -20 or more, reapply thermal paste, nothing seemed to affect temperatures. At one point, I even moved my PC to the opposite side of the room, below a window and near the A/C with cold air blowing in, and even that didn't even help lower it beyond 1-2C.

Finally, I read some random comment in a thread recommending undervolting using the offset, instead of through curve optimizer. I switched it to -0.075 offset per the recommendation in that comment and bam - instant success. Averaging almost 10C lower in Warzone and framerates are very similar. I haven't been benchmarking (as Warzone seems a fairly effective benchmark and arguably more effective stress test since the temps went even higher than any benchmark I had previously tried). So I'm not sure on the exact performance loss you can expect, but I'll happily take a very minimal loss for the 10C.

Amd,A question regarding CPU RMAs,"Hello, everyone!

I was recently approved to get my Ryzen 5 3600 RMA'd due to it spontaneously ceasing to function and giving me DRAM errors/no longer booting even to the BIOS when I've tested all of my other individual components to be working fine without it.

I was wondering if it is necessary for me to send the CPU in its' original packaging? Such as the gray box it origianlly came in.

I looked at AMD's packing instructions, however they only mentioned to not include the heatsink/fan (the cooler it came with) and to put the CPU in its' clamshell packaging so as to protect it during shipping. I no longer have the original packaging, so I'm asking this before shipping it off, or if they need that to confirm the serial number or something.

After removing the sound card and uninstalling drivers - zero issues.  
WHEA errors do not indicate sound card's fault at all, so culprit is elusive.

Amd,Radeon RX 6900 XT vs Radeon Pro W6800 for scientific computation.,"tl;dr: I am doing machine learning and other computationally heavy work, I am looking for the best bang for my buck but I would prefer accuracy over speed. Maybe there is a better card out there, but it would have to be under $2500 for me to even consider because I'll be eating nothing but top ramen for months as is.

&amp;#x200B;

After many years I have decided to build an AMD system instead of Intel for a multitude of reasons the (least of which is that their vendors screwed me on delivery dates 6 months in a row) and if if the benchmarks I've seen are to be believed they're a much better value than Nvidia as well - I don't care about the gaming aspects as I will be using this only for OpenCL or ROCm (unless you can tell me I can Mario Kart 64 in 8K). I am aware that Nvidia's advantage is oversold is mostly because of a bias with game developers optimizing for Nvidia more than they do AMD, and the same can be said of AI developers.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not familiar with AMD's marketing nomenclature so I was hoping someone could shed some light on what to invest my money in: I've narrowed my choices to the recently released Radeon Pro W6800 and the slightly older but float point crunching monster Radeon RX 6900 XT. 

&amp;#x200B;

It would appear a considerable feature of the pro is the fact it has ECC RAM where as the XT does not; but I have been unable to verify that. It is also very nice that it eats less power and defecates less heat.

&amp;#x200B;

For my purposes ECC RAM is most likely far more important than a slightly (&gt;=\~12.%) performance gain. If the 6900XT does have variants out there with ECC memory I would be inclined to go with that because I don't think any of my models will ever reach anywhere near 32 GB.

&amp;#x200B;

All three of the technologies do almost the same thing, adjusting internal resolution in response to input or performance, but they all work in different ways.  
  
CAS does dynamic resolution scaling and sharpening.  (Sort of like a poor man's FSR.)  
  
Radeon Boost dynamically adjusts resolution in response to player input.  (It therefore reduces the internal resolution and boosts performance during moments of action, when there are a lot of key presses.)  
  
FSR renders at a lower internal resolution then resamples it up to a higher resolution, it also has options for dynamic scaling.   
  
I've only had occasion to try CAS (in Cyberpunk), and Boost (in Destiny 2), both of them, I felt, were a reasonable tradeoff between performance and image quality, and from what I've read FSR is even better!  In my opinion AMD has three pretty fucking fantastic performance enhancement technologies, they all do *sorta* the same thing, but they do it in response to different circumstances.  
  
My question: Is FSR the death of CAS and Boost (both of which I have an entirely irrational fondness for), or is there a way that FSR, CAS, and Boost can play well together, or enhance each other?

As there's no bios support for the 5000 series, I decided to grab a €220 R7 3700X as it was on discount.

It's turned out to be a fantastic upgrade. I'm using CTR 2.1 to have individual OC profiles and this thing can overclock amazingly well. I've only had it for a day, haven't really messed around with OC too much, but I can run it at 4.4GHz all core at 1.275V and for single core I run it at 4.6Ghz with 1.4V. Temperatures never go above 75C with a cheap Thermalright True Spirit direct cooler. 

I tested it at 4.7Ghz but it crashed after a few runs of single core Cinebench R23 so I dialled it back to 4.6Ghz. For all core, I could get it to run at 4.5Gz at 1.325, but temperatures went above 80C so I dialled it back to 4.4 at a lower voltage and it works amazingly well.

Amd,"I often see the question of which games should have FSR, but I'd like to set aside the ""should"" and ask what games could potentially -benefit the most- from FSR?","There was a time, not so long ago, when the question ""Yes, but can it play Crysis?"" wasn't a cliche or a punchline, it was a real and sincere question; Crysis, in many ways, wasn't just months ahead of its time, but years.  

If Crysis had FSR when it dropped the question ""Can it play Crysis?"" would have been asked about iGPUs instead of dGPUs.  If Crysis had FSR on the day it dropped then millions more people could have enjoyed the game at launch.  
  
What games, if any, are the Crysis of our generation?  
  
Unfortunately I can't offer a ton of insight, I'm on a Vega 64, I can crank up Monster Hunter World's settings until I have FPS in the single digits; from my perspective MHW could benefit tremendously from FSR, but that says more about my hardware than it does about the game itself.  
  
For the sake of discussion, since there aren't a *ton* of Crysis like games out there right now, I'll broaden the question a little bit: Some games, like anything competitive, benefit directly from increased framerates, even above and beyond a monitor's refresh rate.  
  
Also for the sake of the discussion, let's assume that adding FSR to an existing game costs zero dollars and takes zero minutes.  Consider this a wishlist, of sorts.",False,104,0,1,0

Amd,"First AMD CPU, There is no coming back","After many years of being a loyal Intel customer having owned Core2Due, Core2Quad, i3 3210, i5 4590, i7 4790K, i5 8400 and lastly i7 9700K, I decided to give AMD 5600x a try to pair the CPU with my Gigabyte Aorus 6800XT.

Its was a love from the first boot, outperformed my previous 9700K 8 cores at 5.2ghz in each and every game I played and on every single core benchmark (R20, R23).

Runs as cool as mountain breeze, on custom loop the temps never exceeds 65c with fans (360 rad) set at 1200rpm for silent operations, compared to 1600rpm on 9700k and barely keeping the temps at 70c.

Overclocking, who needs Intel hassle, voltage, LLC...etc when you have PBO 2, easy as slicing a cake, hell, you dont even need to overclock the CPU just yet, its already a beast out of the box

I tried PBO enabled, disabled and advanced with multiple tweaks on scalar and curve Optimizer.

I barely noticed a difference -if any- in gaming edition except better thermals and lower noise.

On PBO disabled my CPU barely reaches 52c, PBO enabled and overclocked 57c and 62c respectively.

Its a beast, when and if you get it dont bother overclocking for gaming performance, you will notice a difference on 1440p.

&amp;#x200B;

Bottom line: For me and I speak for my self, I'll never go back to Intel, that 5600x cost me 280$, that's a bargain for the performance and temps I get. I just love my 5600x.

Amd,6800XT or 3070? (Hear me out why?),"So I got the 6800XT really cheap the other day (£650). This is my first AMD card, I've been using Nvidia all my life but I hated my time with amd for a few reason. One of the most important thing is encoding. I record my ps5 and xbox series x footage via elgato and 6800xt doesn't support 4k 60fps recording, it only support 30fps. I do understand 6800xt has a massive performance boost over 3070. Around 20-25% fps boost depending on the game which is a lot and since I'm a gamer fps matters to me over everything else but now Im considering getting a 3070 from someone by trading the 6800xt and getting £200 cash on top. So 3070 is basically £650 anyway and I'm selling a £650 card and getting £200 on top and I'm getting the encoder supports and stuff and also rtx and dlss suppports are better on Nvidia. I mean if you on dlss which is widely available in tons of games you get similar performance like 6800xt if not better. So I'm just confused if I should do the trade or not or just buy a 1050ti for the encoding stuff and keep the 6800xt??",False,51,0,1,0

Amd,I have been seeing problems since drivers 21.3.2 but I may have found a solution for AMD DRIVER TIMEOUT ERROR,"Let me say that AMD drivers, are something that most people find atrocious, so far I have never had problems since version 13, so I had a pretty much long way before this. Until the version 21.3.2 started giving me the Driver Timeout Error, and I had no real explanation so I moved back to the stable 20.12.1 version.   


After doing quite an extensive Job, seeing what is and not working, even I updated to Windows 11, and same problem. I just decided to stop there, Clean Install, and then, magically everything went great. Until I need one feature and then the problem came back.   


For my use, I have a Huawei phone that uses a Huawei Share thing, that can connect the phone via WIFI as a device on the network as having another PC, being faster than the normal cable connection, even USB3.0, but for that to work they use the **SMB 1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support,** I can't tell It was the problem since I have been using the feature since I got the phone and that dates back to 2019.   


For my clean install I did not activated the Feature, and I was running already 21.6.2 Optional Version, having zero problems so far. As soon I needed a file from my phone, I enabled it, and after a while a DRIVER TIMEOUT ERROR, and the same black screen.   


So I just deactivated and let the system work as usual and wait if the same bug would happen, to my surprise it didn't happen again.   


For reference I will leave my current system specs:  


i7 3770  
8 GB DDR3 1600 MHZ Common Kingston Modules  
480 SSD Adata  
2 TB Seagate for Games  
Asus p8h61-m lx3  
RX 460 Gigabyte Windforce 4GB  


Tested with:  
Windows 11 Pro 22000.65   
Windows 10 Pro 19043  


Main reason I'm sharing this I had been trying to solve this myself and searching for help but seems no one knows exactly. Best solution I got is from AMD and just using the Windows Update Driver Version, but even if that works good, we loose all the Radeon Software capabilities along like Streaming or Recording.   


If this helps anyone, I'm glad. If not maybe we can try to see how to solve it as a community, since I have used this kind of forums for helping me, I feel I can contribute now.

Amd,"PSA: Thermal pads need compression to get their ""rated"" thermal conductivity rating","TL;DR: Thermal conductivity is only one mechanical property to take a look at when buying replacement thermal pads. Thickness, the compression it was tested at and the hardness will also play a factor in your performance. Every GPU will be built differently with different gap sizes. Determining the best thermal pad solution will require a little bit of thinking.

There have been a lot of post about changing thermal pads to lower memory temperatures. Sometimes I see some post where users A reports great results on GPU model ASUS and user B tries the same with a different model Power Color and gets mixed results.

User B purchased the same thermal pads as user A, so why aren't they getting the same results?

This might be an obvious answer to some of you. I'm writing this as a PSA for those that aren't aware that **thermal conductivity rating of pads vary with how much compression is applied.** User A and B have different card manufacturers, they might have different gaps between their cooling solution and their module (memory, chokes, etc.).

Thermal impedance is the inverse of thermal conductivity, so in the test below, lower is better.

&amp;#x200B;

[ A test done by https:\/\/www.lord.com\/products-and-solutions\/electronic-materials\/thermal-management-materials\/gap-fillers-vs-thermal-pads ](https://preview.redd.it/oohqysm8q0b71.png?width=820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e50e2816d602989c00c7b2c27a21a41d7a83eac)

As you can see, the more the pad was compressed, the higher the thermal conductivity (or lower the thermal impedance) became.

This is important because I know a lot of people like to purchase based off of the highest thermal conductivity rating they can find. Lets take Gelid Ultimate as an example. It has a thermal conductivity rating of 15 W/mK, but look at what they on their test.

https://preview.redd.it/xfkijy8eq0b71.jpg?width=1224&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a736106334421d353f2e92bbefff7ffdae258c75

The thermal pad was compressed to 60%. They did a test on a 1mm thick pad and compressed it to a 0.6mm thickness to get this rating.

Furthermore, the shore hardness of this pad is quite hard. Applying this much pressure would probably bend a board.

[ Picture for shock value purposes only ](https://preview.redd.it/95l9k2xgq0b71.jpg?width=453&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2472f26cdab79ae62bd8d83486be276596918003)

Careful now, too much compression can break solder joints, damage modules, etc. So going too thick, applying too much compression is dangerous.

What about thermal putty? Thermal putty is interested because it is more malleable and closer to a paste than it is a hard pad. Putties don't need as much compression or compression at all to get their full thermal conductivity rating.

[A plus with putty pads is that they can compress down significantly — much farther than viscoelastic pads. They require a minimum amount of compression; at least 10%. They also relax over time. Standard gap fillers and putty gap filler pads have essentially the same performance for a given gap. They are soft, and eventually they will bottom out past 80% — what’s referred to as densification. The material is no longer flowing, and is being crushed.](https://www.eetimes.com/compression-characteristics-of-thermal-interface-gap-filler-materials/)

**First before making any changes to registry make a system restore point.**
_____________


So while browsing the registry I noticed the string here  
[https://i.imgur.com/RWCNAk6.png]( https://i.imgur.com/RWCNAk6.png)

You can change this yourself by windwos+r and typing Regedit then press enter


Navigate to  


    Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4d36e968-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\0000
    

And then see if KMD_RebarControlMode exists and if it does not right click -&gt; new dword 32bit and put the name 

    KMD_RebarControlMode


And set the value to hexidecimal value 1



If you don't want to use registry editor you can just run this script here to automatically do it


You can make your own file by opening notepad and pasting this code.


    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
    
    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4d36e968-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\0000]
    ""KMD_RebarControlMode""=dword:00000001


Save the file Rebar.reg and then run the reg file once you saved it. This will enable Rebar in AMD graphics driver

To disable rebar you can run


    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
    
    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4d36e968-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\0000]
    ""KMD_RebarControlMode""=dword:00000000

Same as before name it as Rebaroff.reg and run it.

If you don't want to make it yourself you can download my reg file (U can view the code in notepad to see its not malicious

Amd,Question: 21.x.x Drivers and Eyefinity Bezel correction missing?,"\^ Title.

Last used Eyefinity back on a 390x and it just worked (better then surround, IMHO). Set it up again on RX5700 and there is no bezel correction? The 'AMD Eyefinity Pro' tool does not work either, it cant 'grab' the displays and work with the dimensions. 

so, what gives here? This is definitively 2 large steps back. Just like how AMD removed switchable graphics from their driver packs (we found a work around in windows using HKLM for device over rides). 

u/AMD you need to go back down your feature list and make sure EVERYTHING you list as supported and working is, ya know..., supported and working.

However, I found a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/bzpjpm/amd_please_protect_your_users_against_rambleed/) that discussed that some consumer-grade Ryzen's do in fact support Secure Memory Encryption (SME) aka.

MSI X570 Tomahawk wifi

32gb Corsair vengeance black 3600mhz

be-quiet PSU 1200w 

M2 + multiple SSD's for storage.

Zotac 2080ti AMP Extreme

Windows 10 pro fully updated, all drivers updated, firmware MB latest version, no overclocking of CPU or Graphics card, XMP profile 1 used on memory.

This PC gets us probably 16-18 hours a day which is why the fault didn't show up easily.

Symptom Bluescreen crash or unexpected shutdown only when system is idle.

Benchmarks no problem, streaming games Valhalla/frostpunk,TLD,Legion, VR or transcoding, no issues 100% stability

Go to make some food, or leave pc on with discord running or downloading games while I am asleep and I wake up or come back in to a rebooted login screen if I am lucking if not it is in a black screens cycle with fans on max and hard reset needed to reboot it.

Event viewer shows multiple different reasons, ""unexpected  shutdowns"" ""unable to write error dump"" and so on.

Thought it might be my psu but not only is it an amazing and way over powered, OCCT and other HW info show it as being rock solid stable.

Thought it might be my Graphics card, Vram tests show no issues, GPU tests show no issues.

Multiple mem tests show memory is fine.

Then I did a search on Google and asked Ryzen idle reboot, crash.

The first post I saw said ""was reading discord and my pc shutdown!"" ""gaming doesn't cause it"" next post ""reading reddit and pc shut down.

All of us have AMD performance settings, no power savings turned on and the only theme seems to be Ryzen PC's being idle.

From what I have read it could be something to do with low power state and the voltage going bellow the needed amount to keep the cpu functioning.

Tried most of the fixes.

The only one that seems to work (coming up to 30 hours without a unexpected reboot) is overclocking my CPU and feeding more voltage to the cpu.

I am noticing poor performance that is all over the place and it seems one of the main reasons is that the clocks aren't staying consistent in the less demanding games. It seems like games that are very intensive like cyberpunk (solid 60 at 1440p max settings) and Metro Exodus(solid 90-110 max settings) run great, but games like overwatch and other high frame rate ""simpler"" games are terribly inconsistent. For example my 1080ti is running overwatch at 240 fps at 1080p  constant will virtually no dips. The 6800 will, but it randomly drops all the way down to the 160s-170s and then back up and down all over again.

Drivers are up to date, DDU has been done, I've tried manually setting the clock speeds and power limits, fan curve and all that and it seems the card basically ignores it in most games. Just super disappointed at the moment this card that on paper is excellent and packs a wallop for its price is struggling to compete with a card that is what 4 years old at this point? I've read several threads with similar issues but let me know if AMD has an official solution for this yet as its been almost 8 months since release.

Amd,What Infinity Fabric clock speeds (FCLK) are people achieving on their TR 39XX?,"Hi everyone,

I got a TR 3990x running currently on a Gygabyte Aorus Extreme TRX40 mobo (crap board btw) and coupled with 8 x Gskill Neo 3800 sticks CL14 (timings are actually 14-16-16-36). By default on XMP memory profiles, the system would boot with FCLK at 1800 but memory is at 1900. So I would like to run on 1:1 parity and I was interested if anyone has succesfully ran stable a 3000 series TR with FCLK @ 1900 (mine doesn't post or if it does it quickly becomes unstable).

The whole system, except ram, is under water and I run a 4 GPU system.

So I'm forced to either to downclock the RAM to like 3600 and maybe attempt to tigthen the timings or go agove that like 3666 or 3733 and push the fabric a tad over 1800 for 1:1 parity. My problem is my mobo is crap and won't default BIOS post with 4 GPUs, giving a POST error d4 which can ONLY be bypassed if I get into bios and disable CSM support and enable Above 4G decoding (both are inversely defaulted). So if system becomes unstable, won't post or fails to train the memory timings, I have to disconnect 2 of the GPUs of the 4, without braking the loop apart, get rid of d4 error and then try the bios settings.

So yeah, anyway, I was curious if anyone got 1900 fabric running stable or that's some kind of unicorn for TRs! I'm trying to see if I got a shitty binned CPU or that's the norm.

Amd,Minecraft - Linux vs Windows vs Sodium (Iris) - 32 Chunk showdown,"Since people keep saying that the AMD drivers on Windows are garbage for OpenGL and much better on Linux, I did some testing using Fedora (Workstation Rawhide) vs my windows install.

I wasn't able to get mango hud to work properly so only have FPS from the debug menu on linux vs RTSS overlay + debug menu on Windows. Debug menu (at least on windows) kills high FPS for some reason, maybe how it draws the overlay not sure.

These are all 32 chunks @ 3440x1440 with settings maxed out, vsync off and fps set to unlimited.

[Linux - Regular: 46 fps](https://i.imgur.com/1WQjs57.png)

[Linux - Iris \(Sodium\): 487 fps](https://i.imgur.com/FBQMyYb.jpg)

[Windows - Regular: 41 fps](https://i.imgur.com/xlfeQcd.png) 

[Windows - Iris \(Sodium\): 315 fps](https://i.imgur.com/lrmSCAM.png)

[Windows - Iris \(Sodium\) - No Debug overlay: 593 fps](https://i.imgur.com/60tpEgT.png)

[Windows - Iris \(Sodium\) + ComplementaryShaders \(RT\): 115 fps](https://i.imgur.com/Vh9D4vh.png)


So yes, Linux is faster @ 46 to 41 fps, but the major difference is Sodium is far superior on both, allowing for even Ray tracing shaders on Windows and still having **over double the fps** of the standard renderer in linux.

Amd,Anybody undervolting 5800X on B450M Mortar or other MSI mobo with Lite BIOS?,"Hi All,

Just picked up a 5800X this weekend and so far so good, but compared to the 3700X my average temps are way higher. I have it under a Scythe Fuma 2 with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut. Temps were ranging from 65-75 in Warzone last night, and peaked at 84.1C in OCTT under full load; VRMs only got up to 69C. These CPU temps are quite a bit higher than my 3700X under the same cooler with Arctic Silver. I realize we're talking about chips with way different TDPs and IPCs, so maybe this is normal; open to feedback/insights/experiences from others here.

Anyway, I've had great results undervolting my RTX 3080 to keep temps low with an overclock, and would like to at least undervolt the 5800X, if not undervolt and overclock. I'm not new to any of this, but navigating the AGESA [1.2.0.2](https://1.2.0.2/) light beta BIOS has me a bit confused, especially with the duplication of some settings between panes. I realize I can do most of this in Ryzen Master, but I'd really like to get this done in the BIOS level in case I throw Arch Linux on here.

Anybody out there having any luck doing a BIOS undervolt with any 5000 series CPUs on an MSI B450 Lite Bios motherboard? Or know of any good guides to working with the B450 Lite Bios?

Every few hours especially in games where i get really high framerates like wow and lol (around 250+ if uncapped) the monitor goes black for  1 sek and then back to normal. Its really annoying so i turned off freesync and now the problem is gone.

I now use fast sync as global sync setting and cant see any tearing so far. I usually play wow and shooter around 120 fps, so is there a point where i even benefit from freesync around 120 fps? so far i thought its only affecting low fps games, and the fps above 144hz getting deleted because of fast sync anyways or? im just wondering if i have any negativ effect for turning of freesync at this fps range.",False,4,0,1,0

My main question is what is the best bang for the buck processor for this kind of work?

Amd,"Reference RX Vega crashing, flickering, and black screen solved!","After three years, my reference RX Vega 64 started crashing every time I started up a game. I'd lose all video, and the fan would spin at max speed. My system was fine - I could still hear my friends in Discord, and they could hear me. My video card was dying. 

I've always known this thing runs hot. In most games I was averaging about 82C. I decided to repaste my card and followed this [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwAkmcYCQls). 

After reassembly, the problem seemed to be worse. I was crashing at my desktop now. I fired up hwinfo64 and saw that the GPU hotspot temp was sitting at 90c at just the desktop. As soon as I started any graphics processing, it'd shoot up to 106c, and then the video would crash. 

Okay - so it seemed like a cooling issue, and not a dead component issue. These are the resources I used to guide my fix: 

The suspected location of the hotspot sensor according to several blogs is [here](https://i.imgur.com/3FHVhQt.png) on the chip. 

Info from this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/ainf9h/vega_hotspot_how_i_fixed_it/) encouraging the use of more paste was the real kicker for me. 

I put on a gratuitous amount of paste, used a latex gloved finger to wedge it into the gap between the GPU and the HBM, and then made sure it was evenly spread on the chips and vapor chamber.

I then followed this [guide](https://www.igorslab.de/en/amd-radeon-rx-vega-of-ominoese-hotspot-and-the-right-application-of-waermeleitpaste/) for tightening up the cooler. DO NOT SKIP THIS. 

I seated the vapor chamber as tight as I could without stripping the screws. 

I also set my fan curve to be much more aggressive in Wattman. 

My new temps are much better. My hotspot hasn't gone above 90c. I hope this guide can save and prolong the life of other's Vegas as we wait out the chip shortage and GPU craze.",False,4,0,1,0

I apologize if I am asking a repeated questions. This is my first time doing this and online forums give me conflicting information. From what I understand, it is best practice to do a fresh install of Windows when making a full on motherboard switch to make sure drivers don't conflict.

Could someone outline the steps in detail that I would need to take to make this change in a safe and effective manner? This is what I have gathered from forums and videos so far.

1. Backup any file data (pictures, videos, documents, game save files, etc...)

2. Create a boot USB of Windows 10 from their website. (I already have tied my digital license to my Windows Account)

3. Format my current SSD with Windows 10 Home Edition to clear it.

3. Move my cleared SSD to my new motherboard. Install the fresh copy of Windows 10 using my boot USB. Login to my account to transfer over the license. 

4. Re-install any programs and files that I had on my old platform.

Amd,Looking for guidance from experienced PC Hobbyists,"Hi all,

I'm pretty new to the PC game having built my machine last summer and I had questions about running my gpu fans all the time.

I have two monitors (Main: 165hz, Secondary: 144hz), and like all of you when I run both at their maximum refresh rate my GPU MCLK spikes to max and stays there even if the PC is idling. I know why this happens, but was wondering if this is bad for the overall longevity of my GPU. In theory the fans running all the time would cause more wear and tear, but is this negligible over the life span of a card I intend to use for 3-5 years?

Or am I better off capping my refresh rate at 120hz and letting the card idle at a lower MCLK?

Hey guys dont know if im really dumb but i just found out what ASW Was and turns out that if it is enabled manually in the debug menu the gpu only works half as hard to produce the fps for the headset as it only renders one frame and makes calculated adjustments for the other eye which allows for double the performance and fps allowing you to crank up the graphics settings

just go into the debug console and run the asw launch command and set it to make 90 fps and it will work just load up task manager before you run it while a game is running and then press enter and watch the gpu usage drop

Amd,My experience with AMD Ryzen 5 4650G,"I made the original post on a local subreddit 3 months back. I just wanted to share my happiness with the folks at r/Amd

I wanted to build a cheap PC which can game and will have generally good performance. I have been trying to get a cheap GPU like the RTX 2060 Super or GTX 1660 Super, but i was out of luck. No retailer had those cards in stock and the RTX 3060 and RTX 3060Ti were out of stock and/or sold at double their launch price set by Nvidia. I even asked a local shop about a custom pc with Intel Core i5-10400F (he didn't have 3600) and a RTX 3060. He quoted me a price of RS 1.15 lakhs ($1540), which was wayyy above my budget. I turned to the used market then, only to be disappointed yet again. Most of the used graphics cards were literally being sold above their msrp at which they launched, which is ridiculous!!

Dejected, I went back to the drawing board, and hoped to build a system with AMD Ryzen 5 3400G and later, maybe after 1-2 years, install a brand new GPU in the system. I looked up AMD Ryzen 5 3400G reviews. I was surprised to know the 3400G didn't in fact use the Ryzen 3000 series processor as the name suggests. Instead, it uses an older Ryzen 2000 series CPU and a Vega 11 GPU cores. I was disappointed again. I don't want to buy a 4 year old CPU right? That's when I started to notice a strange CPU being pushed by the youtube algorithm to me.

AMD Ryzen 5 4650G Pro. That's a lot of terms for a single product. The 4650G is an OEM only processor as far as i know, it is based on the AMD Ryzen 3000 series 7nm architecture. It has performance similar to the Ryzen 5 3600 and actually scored similar to the 3600 in geekbench 5, which is the only benchmark I ran. Anyway, I was surprised that AMD has not released the 4650G as a boxed product. It's an incredible product at times like this. I googled where I could buy the 4650G online in India, and I was directed to the product page of MDComputers. Well, I placed my order for a 4650G (Rs 17,260, $230) along with an A520m motherboard. I know, I know, A520 isn't the best AMD motherboard chipset out there, it doesn't support Overclocking, and is pretty entry level, but it supports 4650G natively without any bios update which i can confirm. That's exactly what I was looking for. So I ordered the rest of the parts through MDComputers itself. I couldn't find a reasonably priced 8Gb 4000Mhz x2 ram on any other site and I also brought a 650W power supply and a cabinet along with it. I know, 650W is overkill, but I plan to drop in a 3070 or 3060 Ti as soon as I can get my hands on one. The Vega 7 iGPU on the 4650G greatly benefits from ram modules running at higher frequency, so i advise not to cheap out on ram. 8 Gb 3200Mhz x2 is good enough.

MDComputers quickly processed my order and had it shipped. All of the components arrived at my house in Kerala within one week. The processor came sandwiched in-between foam, taped on top of the stock AMD cooler. I was lucky my brother didn't throw away the foam thinking it was extra packaging. lol So be careful about that. I quickly put the CPU in the socket, attached the cooler, put the ram and m.2 SSD in, setup the case and voila, I was running the pc in less than an hour. I quickly installed CSGO and Genshin Impact.  I attached a new MSI Optix G241 monitor to the build and was surprised to know that the HDMI port integrated into the motherboard supports both 144Hz and FreeSync at the same time!! And wow, I got 170fps on the ulletical csgo fps benchmark at 1080p and a smooth 60fps on Genshin at medium settings. I couldn't believe my eyes. This is literally running on an iGPU. I was really impressed. I'll still buy a GPU when the prices come down as I wanna play more games. But right now, this is the best stopgap solution in my opinion. Used market is overpriced with the additional anxiety whether the product will work etc, new GPUs are unavailable to purchase etc etc.

Edit1: Disabling TSME in BIOS settings will give a performance boost of \~10% fps in games. It's some sort of enterprise security firmware for AMD, the ""PRO"" part of the cpu.

Also, changing the ""UMA Frame buffer size"" in ""Advanced/NB Configuration'' from ""Auto"" (512mb) to ""2G"" will increase the VRAM allocated to the iGPU from 512mb to 2GB. Absolutely do this if you have 16GB ram. It will smoothen out some frame drops in games.

I was playing csgo fine till one day when it started stuttering. I thought I was done for, that i made a mistake purchasing this APU, but after a bit of troubleshooting using the included Radeon software, I realised that the iGPU has saturated the 512mb of VRAM and was causing stutters. By some god's grace, techquickie youtube channel released a video on VRAM that day and it literally told me how to ""Increase VRAM on your system"" lol.

TLDR: Took a risk and bought an OEM iGPU in 2021 and i am happy, considering the current situation.

Why does AMD seem to handicap itself with software deficiencies?","I am going purely on anecdotal experience here. Switching to an nVidia GPU was a very positive experience with quick driver updates and no crashes.

The chipset issues are harder to pin down but I occasionally feel like the PC just becomes randomly unstable with some random delays in Windows 10, frustrating USB device disconnects, and occasional random reboots when waking from sleep. I dont remember struggling with this on Intel platforms. I really appreciate the value AMD has brought forth on it's AM4 platform and I am enthusiastic about supporting them. But it took almost a year before 5700XT drivers became stable and it's taking even longer for them to resolve everyone's issues with X570 chipset. Is this just how AMD is and I have to keep waiting it out? If so, why isn't this more widely advertised in reviews in AMD products?",False,9,0,1,0
Amd,miserable cpu-z scores on a ryzen 5600x,"Hi

I bought my 5600x about 3 months ago, and its having miserable scores on cpu-z benchmarks. the 5600x has the best multi-core score from all 12 thread cpus. but mine isn't. my 5600x multicore score is lower than a 4600g. also, the single core score is 3 points more than a 3300x. is this normal? I currently have PBO turned on.

(sorry for my bad English)

Amd,Any tweaking tools for AMD Bristol Ridge/Carrizo CPUs?," I have this Biostar A10N-9830E and its something very interesting being a Bristol Ridge part released in 2020. Uses a mobile FX 9830p CPU that's soldered onto the motherboard. [https://www.biostar.com.tw/app/en/mb/introduction.php?S\_ID=974#overview](https://www.biostar.com.tw/app/en/mb/introduction.php?S_ID=974#overview)

Since its on Excavator architecture pre-Ryzen, its obviously pretty damn slow but the R7 graphics surprisingly performs decently and I wanted to use this as an HTPC or a cheap gaming PC. Especially because it costed me something like $85 for the whole thing.

 [Nero10578\`s 3DMark - Fire Strike score: 2019 marks with a Radeon R7 Graphics Mobile (Bristol, 512 Shaders) (hwbot.org)](https://hwbot.org/submission/4779434_nero10578_3dmark___fire_strike_radeon_r7_graphics_mobile_(bristol_512_shaders)_2019_marks) 

However, it seems like the CPU doesn't actually boost properly for some reason. The specs says it should boost to 3.7GHz and in this case it even has a 3.8GHz boost that it hits in light loads, but on full load it just locks to 3.2GHz.  
I know boost is an up to spec and usually for single threaded workloads, but considering this is not in a space confined laptop I think Biostar just sets a too low TDP value or something. Because the Asus FX550IU laptop that had this same CPU can boost to 3.5GHz all core speed.

So the result is as you can see abysmal CPU performance lol since its only at 3.2GHz.  [Nero10578\`s Cinebench - R15 with BenchMate score: 282 cb with a FX-9830P (hwbot.org)](https://hwbot.org/submission/4779402_nero10578_cinebench___r15_with_benchmate_fx_9830p_282_cb) 

Is there a tool that can be used to tweak the performance of this CPU? Like Ryzen Master or 1usmus CTR for Ryzen. Or the AMD APU tuning utility for Ryzen APUs. I found AMDmsrtweaker but it doesn't seem to do anything. Sure I can change the P states voltages and clocks for the boost P0-2 states but it just still throttles back to 3.2GHz on full load.

If not can someone help mod the bios to make available the hidden settings or change the TDP setting to the max 45W supported by the APU? I will really appreciate it. The stock BIOS literally has nothing that's changeable in terms of performance tweaking except for disabling CPB and memory voltage and speed settings.

The bios for the motherboard is on the website here: [https://www.biostar.com.tw/app/en/mb/introduction.php?S\_ID=974#download](https://www.biostar.com.tw/app/en/mb/introduction.php?S_ID=974#download)

I tried posting on the win-raid bios request forums as well since I am not sure how to BIOS mod this myself with the guides there as this is an uncommon platform. I would be willing to pay for anyone able to help with this as well as long as its a reasonable amount.

My daughter has been begging me to upgrade my system so she can get get it. My old card is a Vega 64 and even though getting 5600XT would technically be a downgrade, the 5600XT comes within 2% of the Vega 64 and in some games it actually outperforms it (1080p).

Amd,"AMD RX6000XT low GPU usage, clock speed, and FPS in older games. Are AMD acknowledging and working on a resolution?","I am having, as many have been, issues with my new RX6000 series card.

Whereby some older games don't seem to be detected as a 3D application, and the system is not assigning GPU resource to that application, and the GPU is not clocking up. 

As an example, Minecraft with shaders, and Fallout New Vegas. When playing either game, the GPU only runs at 500MHz, and around 20% usage, resulting in worse performance than, for example, an old R9 290X.

Sometimes the FPS briefly spikes to the few hundred FPS heights I expect to see, when loading another 3D application or opening a piece of software that spikes the GPU utilisation and clock speed, it then dips and returns to being practically unplayable again. This tells me that it should be an easy fix.

Are AMD aware of an issue and planning to fix this? Or am I getting rid of this GPU and looking out for an NVIDIA alternative?  


\[This is an actual issue, Gigabyte even released a new BIOS for one of their GPU's to help alleviate some of the symptoms.

Amd,LG 27GN950B HDR 4k 144Hz 10Bit Grey Screen upon driver update,"I have an LG 27GN950B 4k monitor. It runs at 10bpc (10 bit color). It uses DSC 1.4a with a brand new display port cable I bought from Amazon to handle 8k@60hz and 4k@144hz. I'm using an MSI Gaming Trio 6800XT.

When I update the AMD driver from 21.3.1 to anything above that, the screen goes completely grey at the Windows login screen, then the monitor shuts off. I have to hard boot the system at which point, pre windows stuff shows up, but get the grey Windows login screen again. If I set the monitor to DSC 1.2 and hard reboot, I can see windows again, albeit at 60Hz.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to fix all this I have to reboot in safe mode, use DDU to take the drivers out, then reinstall 21.3.1. I have tested this with 21.6.1 and 21.6.2. 21.5.1 FAILS with an error every time. 

I have tried to set color depth to 8 bit, and turn off DSC 1.4a BEFORE installing the new driver but this makes no difference. Why is this happening? Why am I not able to simply update my drivers? Why am I stuck with this driver revision?

Amd,Best way to squeeze some more FPS out of 3800x + 5700XT?,"Hey all, I finally got to a point where I’m thinking of tweaking my system a bit to squeeze some more performance out of it. 

Mobo: x570 Aourus Master
CPU: 3800x

RAM: Corsair Vengeance (running at DDR4 stock atm)

For various reasons I’ve left this build at stock until I was confident it wasn’t going to just crash on me out of nowhere. What tweaks can I do to best get some more FPS out of my system and preferably keep stable FPS in game. I play a lot of Hunt: Showdown and I get the occasional FPS drop, but currently get like ~75FPS at max settings.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no extra cooling apparatus besides the stock fans that come with the case, the cpu is a ryzen 7 3700x with the stock wraith rgb cooler. I would like to lower my gpu temps by about 10 degrees overall if possible. Running cpu intensive games like overwatch only gets the gpu to the 70s or low 80s which I am fine with as I don't play for long durations, however i tried to play metro exodus with ray tracing and wow I got to 95 degrees almost instantly. So heres the few questions I have

&amp;#x200B;

1) Would getting a liquid cpu cooler give the gpu more room to breathe temp wise?

2) Is the 6900xt locking to 500mhz in certain games related to the temps or just an amd bug? (For example overwatch with go well past 2000mhz but a game like intruder will not go over 500mhz ever its locked to it somehow and changing the clock speeds manually in radeon does nothing.

3)  Any other possible ways to bring temps down without buying a mid-ATX case. I understand the biggest culprit of the heat is the psu directly below the gpu choking it to a degree in more intensive games, I don't think this will be able to be remedied entirely of course, but if it can be mitigated by 15-20% I'll be more than happy.

I figured it might be bad contact due to the weird AM4 mounting method, so I re-mounted and swapped paste for cryonaut (Expensive stuff but figured I might as well). it DID bring temps down a bit... but not much. Idle is like 55.5, touching the mouse pushes it to 60. That said, under load it seems to stay in the mid 70s most of the time so its not throttling. Just curious if that high of an idle is normal. The CPU it replaced, a 7700k, idled in the low 30s most of the time, and my old 4790k idled at 28.

Amd,"R9 280 vs WX 4100 for four display setup (2x4K, 2x1080p)?","I'm building a new PC and am looking for an AMD GPU. I have two 4K monitors next to each other, than two 1080p monitors on top of the 4K ones. Currently I have an Nvidia NVS 510 which only has 2GB of DDR3, and apparently this setup is rather close to the bandwidth limit of the DDR3 which is likely why it stutters sometimes. And the drivers for the NVS 510 suck as I'm on linux.

I was initially looking at buying two WX 3100s or a WX 4100. But the BAPC Discord instead suggested an R9 280, one with two mini DP ports, a HDMI, and DVI port.

But now I have found a WX 4100 for £110-120, vs £90 for the R9 280. Originally the WX 4100 was £160 when bapc suggested the R9 280.

Question is what would you guys suggest? What extra features would I get with the WX 4100, do you think the price increase is worth it? The only advantage I could see is that I could upgrade the 1080p monitors to 4K if I ever wanted to (although I don't plan to).

Are there other advantages? I also have an interest in GPGPU and I imagine the WX 4100 would be better for that? Although this isn't a concrete requirement by any means.",False,10,0,1,0

Amd,HDMI / Display Port Cables Can Cause Your GPU To Appear Dead / Bricked,"Hey, felt the need to offer a small PSA. 

I have just had a hell of a time dealing with an incredibly stupid and specific issue. A perfectly normal-looking HDMI cable was causing my 6800 XT to produce black screens after bios, but would function in Safe mode and Bios correctly.

This normally points to a dead video card, however, through hours of testing everything from a riser to pcie slots to OCs, vbios flashes, More Power Tool, Soft Power Play Tables, power connectors, PSU, motherboard bios configuration, and completely disassembling and reassembling my entire PC.. that a f\*\*\*ing HDMI cable short, on an undamaged perfectly normal looking HDMI, was causing my GPU to bootloop once I logged into Windows. So, PC is stable, GPU bootloops, evidenced through fan RPM responses and the RGB led radeon logo turning off then back on again.

HDMI / DISPLAY PORT CABLES CAN RARELY CAUSE COMPONENTS TO APPEAR TO BE FAILING.

This is probably obvious to most people, \*but it can be extremely confusing if it only fails some of the time.\*

In my instance, both the Bios and Windows safe mode were working, which meant that the cables were functioning, or at least, not f\*\*\*ing up other components, at least some of the time, hence why it was such a late thing that I tried.

Anyway. Hope this helps someone else, Thought I bricked my midnight edition and had a slightly emotional few hours resetting and reassembling a PC.

So SupportAssist didn't update me to Adrenaline 2020 edition, so I went on AMDs website, used the auto detect and downloaded the newest drivers software.

Now everyday for the last four days, Radeon has given me the error code that the drivers/software don't match up. And have had to reinstall on a daily basis, although my 5900x is extremely fast, it doesn't take to long, but is very annoying having to wait for my shaders to download again.

I also get a weird code after turning my computer on after being off that my hardware has changed and should restart.

I read somewhere recently that I should have kept the ""lite Radeon"" software on, and that it could be found on windows store. I also read to stay away from the Ryzen Master, on tis Alienware, that the Alienware Command Center causes the Ryzen Master to crash, haven't tried RM yet, although I would like to utilize the boosted memory afforded to me for having both AMD GPU&amp;CPU

A 2070 super seems like it was the better purchase, because it gets DLSS, RTRT, and DX12U support. AMD wont even give RDNA1 cards SAM support. IMO its the least they could do. It reminds me of the shift from DX9 to DX10, and the gpus that were left in the dust so to speak. I know there is still plenty of life left in these cards, but i am getting buyers regret.

Amd,"Edge of Eternity Tech Q&amp;A – Midgar CEO on AMD FSR vs NVIDIA DLSS, PS5 vs XSX and More","By Alessio Palumbo / Jul 2, 2021 12:00 EDT from WCCF Tech, title of post is also the title of the article on that site.
Here are relevant parts for PC version of the game:

Edge of Eternity recently launched on PC, at long last, with console versions due later this year. Given that the game is one of only two (the other being Necromunda: Hired Gun) confirmed to support both NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR technologies, we thought it was a great time to once again chat with Midgar Studio CEO Jérémy Zeler-Maury, who also happens to be the game's lead programmer.


Can you compare the process of implementing AMD's FSR and NVIDIA's DLSS in Edge of Eternity? Which differences did you encounter?


Implementing DLSS was quite complex to integrate into Unity for a small studio like us; it required tweaking the engine and creating an external plugin to bridge Unity and DLSS. It was complicated, but in the end, it gave amazing results. FSR, on the other hand, was very easy to implement, it only took me a few hours, requiring only simple data. However, it did require the source data to be as sharp as possible since FSR is not a deep learning method and cannot reconstruct loss details. We needed to replace the built-in Unity TAA with the AMD Cauldron TAA (opensource) that we ported to Unity as it is a lot better at preserving details.


Quality-wise, do you feel there is a noticeable difference between the two in your game? Also, do you expect many other developers to implement both technologies in their titles?


Quality-wise, when there is a lot of pixel info available for upscaling to 4K, both technologies give amazing results, and I have a hard time seeing differences between them. I’d even say that I slightly prefer the FSR for 4K resolution since it doesn’t introduce any artifacts/minor blurriness that DLSS can sometimes introduce. For lower resolutions like upscaling to 1080p or 720p, I think DLSS gives a better result since it can reconstruct parts of missing details due to the nature of the technique. That said, I'm playing Edge of Eternity on a GPD Win3 (Intel APU), and using FSR to upscale to 720p gives a very similar result to native on a small screen like that and allows 60 FPS gameplay.

I think FSR being very easy to integrate means more games are going to get it, DLSS is more complicated to integrate. Aside from pre-integrated versions in engine (UE already has it and it’s coming to Unity but only for HDRP, whereas our integration is for the built-in pipeline) or AAA games, I don’t think many small developers will integrate it.


Back to the PC version of Edge of Eternity. Did you consider adding DirectX 12 support? Could this still happen post-launch, perhaps with some DX12 Ultimate features like ray tracing, sampler feedback, mesh shaders, or variable rate shading?


Unfortunately, the Unity DX12 implementation on the built-in pipeline is not solid enough. We have worse performance in DX12, and they made all the cool features available only for HDRP. Switching to this pipeline would basically require us redoing the project from scratch, so it’s very unlikely to happen.


Will you keep using the Unity engine for your next titles or consider switching to something else?


We’ll evaluate for the future depending on the project, but we’ll likely switch to Unreal Engine *5 in the future due to the open-source nature of the engine that allows us to modify it for our needs.",False,151,0,1,0

Amd,Asrock x570 Phantom Gaming 4 bios update p4.10," Not sure if anyone else ran into this issue but thought I'd share what worked for me...

A while back, I updated my bios to p3.20 to prep myself if I ever upgraded to a 5000 series cpu because I read on reddit that a lot of builders will upgrade their cpu without updating their bios with their previous cpu, and then a lot of times they have to reinstall their previous cpu just to update their bios and then reinstall the new cpu - which can be a lot of unwanted work... unless you have an msi motherboard where you can just flash the bios with a usb and with the button on the motherboard.

Then I read somewhere on reddit that you should always update bios on motherboards because it fixes a lot of stability issues, etc. So I updated my bios to p4.10, but my pc kept getting stuck on the boot and I started panicking and reverting the bios back to previous versions. Every version I reverted back to, my pc would get stuck while booting maybe like 50% of the time... After 6-7 flashes of different bios, I remembered what happened back when I updated my bios to p3.20 (previous paragraph)... I read somewhere on reddit that asrock x570 boards ""support"" PCIE 4 but run into a lot of issues. A redditor in the post said to change the bios setting to PCIE 3 instead of auto or PCIE 4 and it should fix the issue. Had I remembered to do this again while updating my bios to p4.10, I wouldn't have spent an hour trying to flash my bios repeatedly to fix the booting issue thinking that it was a faulty bios update...

Long story short, if you're updating your bios on an asrock x570 mobo and then issues starting coming up like running into booting issues or maybe even other issues... try switching bios settings to PCIE 3 instead of auto or PCIE 4 and hopefully that'll fix your issue like it did for me!",False,2,0,1,0

Since this year with driver 20.12.1\* my RX 5700 XT always has the memory running at full speed instead of clocking down to 200 MHz in idle. (Additionally the frequency is now an unusual range between 1742 MHz and 1744 MHz instead of fixed 1750 MHz.) This results in high idle power usage (28W instead of 7W) and temps too and the fans ramping up every few mins - this is not ok. :|

I suspect it may have sth. to do with the changes regarding the incorrect idle (GPU) clock reporting that was the case with the previous versions and has been finally fixed with 20.12.1.

\\\* But maybe this broke already earlier like 20.11.\*; haven't tested, but 20.9.1 works fine in that regard.

I  want to continue upgrading my computer. I am wondering if a 3900X is  worth it? I only have an Radeon RX 580 8GB GPU rn but in the (far)  future I'm going to switch to a better NVIDIA (sorry)

The  reason I want to switch is because I have switched to a new rendering  program that uses NVIDIA primarily, which I don't have, so it uses my  CPU. I can't afford a new GPU rn but I can maybe swing a new CPU.

I  am a gamer but not an insanely heavy one. I play minecraft and second  life a lot (sl uses CPU also instead of GPU). The Sims sometimes. I  would like to play better games but I just haven't gotten to doing it  yet. The most intense ones I've played are Visage and Amnesia Rebirth or  whatever it was called.

I've got an ASRock A320M-HDV R4.0 (AM4) mobo rn and I'm not currently keen on replacing it, but it says that it should take it.

I have worked in IT/Project Management &amp; Product Management with a focus on user experience for 8 years, not micro electrical engineering or computer engineering. I am at best a enthusiast who can read. Take my opinion and my thoughts with a grain of salt. If you know better than me, enlighten me RESPECTFULLY. 

&amp;#x200B;

Into the meat:

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Ryzen CTR?** 

From [guru3d.com](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/clocktuner-for-ryzen-download.html)

""*CTR (ClockTuner for Ryzen) software allows each user to customize the system with maximum energy efficiency. In this case, CTR is fully automated and does not limit the user in actions. The program has a kind of artificial intelligence, which will help in any situation, and the protection system will monitor each step so that your components were not exposed to danger. CTR is compatible with all motherboards on the AM4 socket, despite the artificial limitations of AMD. As for conditions, it is probably one thing - the processor should be based on ZEN2 and now ZEN3 architecture. CTR is made by Guru3D's oldtimer 1USMUS.*""

&amp;#x200B;

My easy explanation: It is a adaptive undervolting utility for Ryzen 2 and 3 CPUs that can also be used to OC to a limited degree via voltage increases. Created by [1usmus](https://twitter.com/1usmus?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)

&amp;#x200B;

**Now why do I elude to it being a bit polarizing in the title?** 

The Negative:

Many people do not think its worth it or that it is more than anything ""snake oil"" (please for the love of god if you want to call it snake oil in the comments, at least provide some more information for others to see your claim) Going as far to identify that it can start running at a super high voltage that degrades your CPU over time. There is a great write up by [Chips and Cheese located here](https://chipsandcheese.com/2021/02/15/ctr-safety-revisited/) that goes into the details of their findings and concerns. 

The Positive: 

A high degree of the positive is recorded by the creator themselves (1usmus), anecdotal commenters across the webs who see performance or at least heat reduction, and article writers who have tried it themselves. Good reviews and writers have acknowledged the dangers and have warned about its downsides. Chris Cunningham wrote a great review/walkthrough of it on [LI Blog](http://blog.logicalincrements.com/2021/03/clock-tuner-ryzen-ctr-2-1-pbo-curve-optimizer/) and of course [Linus did a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W872lQcy65I) on it awhile back.

&amp;#x200B;

My uneducated Take:

I have tried CTR multiple times over updates since getting my 5950x. I have always had issues getting it to work. Back before RC5 2.1, I got it to work and saw temps reduced quite a bit but with that came a bit lower performance. This was before the new profiles and before I tuned it for more performance.

However, since RC5 2.1, I cannot get it to work. I do not blame the program itself, more the lack of documentation for anything other than ROG bios. I have an AORUS Master x570 pared with my 5950x and AORUS bios documentation and function is really REALLY bad. Like worse than ASRock was back in the late 2000s/early 2010s. I cant get settings to stick sometimes, there is no search function, there are settings that no-one seems to know when they overwrite the exact same settings other places. Its abysmal. The only reason I went with it was because it was the only board with 3 m.2s, 6 satas, and 8 fan headers with great VRMs. Anyway this isn't about AORUS its about CRT.   


I like the premise behind CRT but feel the lack of documentation, lack of User Guidance in app, throw off a lot of users who might even know a lot about PCs. Igors Lab has a great walk through that actually include AORUS documentation by skullbringer. (article Linked above)

&amp;#x200B;

Final thoughts:

I cannot express how much I appreciate 1usmus for creating this program. It takes time and research and A LOT of work. I do not want to overlook that or disrespect it. (and I ask you to do the same if you comment) I want to get this working and I want to better understand it.

Amd,R7 5800X - Should I be worried about these temperatures?,"Just completed my first PC build 2 weeks ago and the high temps have been bothering me. My previous prebuilt gaming PC had significantly lower temps with a stock air cooler.

**SPECS**

CPU: Ryzen 7 5800x

GPU: MSI RX 6800XT Gaming Trio

CPU Cooler: Cooler Master ML240 AIO

RAM: 4x 8GB Corsair Vengeance

Motherboard: MSI B550M Mortar WiFi

Case: Phanteks Eclipse P500A

PSU: 750W Cooler Master 80+ Gold

Monitors: 2x 1440P 144hz

Storage: 1TB PCIE 4.0 SSD

Ambient temperature: 21C (air conditioned)

My GPU temps are great. 35C at idle and 60+ when gaming on ultra. Airflow doesn't seem to be an issue.

However the 5800x runs at 50-55C at **IDLE** and 70C+ when gaming. In the first minute or so after boot up temperatures sometimes spike to 80C+. Latest driver and firmware updates installed. Everything is on stock settings. No OC. Power plan set to default (balanced). Reseated/repasted cooler but no improvement. I think thermal paste has been applied perfectly.

* light video editing
* casual gaming (factorio, rdr2, the witcher, ... not really the highend games)

I'm easily capable of maxing out all 8c/16t on my current 3700x in batch editing (which happens enough).

So i'm wondering which zen3 would make the most sense to get. The 5600x seems a loss to the 3700x, the 5800x is a weird beast and the 5900x seems perhaps too much. I'm not sure.

Running a 3600XT with a 3060Ti on ASRock x570 Phantom 4, 2x8gb 3600 RAM. So far as I can tell, everything is running pretty well. I'm trying to squeeze a little more performance out of it; I read the 3600XT overclocks well at 4.6 but I think my motherboard is preventing that - instant blue screen when I tried changing the settings in BIOS. Overclocked GPU at a safe place, enabled XMP so most of my bases are covered.

Overclocking the CPU would be nice, but I've read that anything less than 4.6GHz isn't worthwhile.

If anyone has more advice for the system I'd love to hear it. I'm already scoring above average for the system in benchmarks, but it seems like there's a little bit further I could push it - just not sure how.",False,7,0,1,0

My analysis:

The most popular ones seem to be the 6800xt, followed by the 6700xt.

Since AMD is getting good yields and they're selling everything they're probably making a lot more 6900XTs than 6800s

The 6700xt has the highest availability.

The 6800 seems to be the least sought-after (probably because it's so rare and it runs pretty hot)

So the best choice would be the 6700xt followed by the 6900xt, 6800 and 6800xt.

Amd,"Yet ANOTHER 5900x vs 5950x question, but from a slightly different perspective","Most of the questions out here are ""will the 5950x get me more frames"" and I've absorbed all the advise there. The takeaway is that the difference won't be appreciable and most games are going to benefit from more cache per core since they aren't programmed to use all of the cores in the 5950x. Makes sense to me. 

My question is only slightly different, but seemed worth asking.

Use case &amp; goals:  
My primary use case getting the longest life possible out of the build for AAA 2k/4k gaming.  
For reference, I'm upgrading from a 6 or 7 year old coffee lake 8700k based system with a 1080 ti, so I'm hoping to build a system that will stay relevant around 5-7 years and maybe longer with a GPU upgrade in the 4-6 year timeline.

History:  
I built a full rig at microcenter just to get a 3080 ti (They reserve the cards for in store builds and I only paid 200 over msrp so I'm calling it a win). I figured I'd just go with sensible top shelf components to make the whole system last as long as possible. So I walked out with a MSI 3080 ti gaming trio, 5900x, and a MSI MAG x750. I had literally the worst install experience in my 30+ years of building systems, which I won't get in to because I need help with comparing components, not a place to vent. Anyway, I ended up with a system that won't post. The MSI board indicates that the CPU is the issue, and all of the other components work fine when tested in another rig. Microcenter is perfectly willing to exchange the CPU for me, but supply issues have left me without a CPU for this box for over a week. They are willing to let me exchange, but don't anticipate having more in stock any time soon.

There are no 5900x's in stock at any local microcenter stores, but there are 5800's in both of my closest locations and 5950's in stock at a different store within driving distance. The cost really doesn't matter to me as much as getting this build up and stable. It seems that, from a AAA game perspective, I won't see any realistic difference between the 5800, 5900x, and 5950x. 

Question:  
I haven't built an AMD based system since my Phenom II way back when, so I'm just a little out of my depth when attempting to make apples to apples comparisons. My end goal is to get the most value out of my system through longevity. I hope to skip the next gen of cpu's and video cards entirely, so I'm soliciting advise on what to purchase in place of the 5900x.",False,76,0,1,0

Amd,"Had to RMA my 3900x, fingers crossed","Warning, long story ahead!

Ever since I first built my system last March, I had noticed problems occasionally with random things: rebooting sometimes hung during initial motherboard post, random hard locks (everything just freezes on screen forcing a hard power cycle), could never really get PBO or any kind of memory clock adjustments to work or be stable, and random occasional bsod triggering a restart.

My system: x570 Aorus Elite, 64gb 3200 ram, Sapphire Nitro+ 5700xt, 3900x.

For a long time, I assumed many of these issues to be bios or gpu driver related issues. I also ran hyper-v virtualization, which means that Windows itself is technically running in a hypervisor at that point and not bare metal so I wrote off the PBO and memory clocking problems as an artifact of not running bare metal. 

My system only seemed stable if I kept memory clocks at the bios defaults of 2400mhz and any XMP profiles just caused instability-freezes, bsods, etc. In fact, I bought another pair of 16gb sticks hoping for an improvement but it never made a difference.

For the motherboard post issues, it started getting so bad I’d avoid shutting down or restarting unless absolutely necessary since it was starting to take me several hard power cycles before I could get it to finally post, and then there was the time I just let it sit and about 10 minutes later I heard it post finally.

Well, a couple of weeks ago my system just shut off randomly and I couldn’t get it to come back to life. I tried everything I could think of: new PSU, 2 different brand new motherboards, trying each ram module individually, clearing cmos multiple times, etc.

After the 2nd new motherboard wouldn’t post I came to the conclusion that the problem was the cpu. It was the last thing I’d ever thought would crap out on me, but all the various component testing confirmed it for me. So, as of today, my 3900x should be getting delivered to AMD in Miami, and I’ll just be waiting to find out what they decide to do.

In hindsight, now knowing that my cpu is bad, I’m fairly sure it may have been the culprit of many of those issues for the past year all along.  Certainly bios and driver updates fixed some of those problems, but the memory clocking and PBO problems specifically I could see being directly tied to a fault in the cpu, so I’m hoping that whatever replacement I get (whether via RMA from AMD or out of pocket) will result in a system that runs the way it always should have. 

I’ve loved this system and have really been impressed with the 3900x despite the issues, so I can only imagine how good it will be with a properly functioning cpu lol. 

Out of curiosity, has anyone else had to RMA their cpu, and if you have, what’s been your experience with the process?",False,5,0,1,0

Amd,"6800XT Time Spy Score - Excellent and Surprising - 20,986 Graphics Score","I have a reference (AMD) 6800xt which I enjoy overclocking just to beat [time-spy](https://www.3dmark.com/spy/21101201) scores. I [watercool](https://imgur.com/a/5leEa1z) on an Alphacool block, inside a LL 011d Mini. 2x360, 1x240. I came from a TT V71 which kept things a little bit cooler.

My original goal was to **break 20,000** \- which happened by about 3-400 points. *Stock on air was 17,710*. Watercooling alone bumped the score by 4-500. I started to get into the 20,5XX range. Not much changed when I went from a 3900x to a 5900x (PBO on). But just recently I got this new score which surprised me - I think the latest drivers improved GPU optimization. I updated because of FSR. Curious if anyone else saw this bump just by **updating drivers**.  I see that clock speed registered at 2710 which previously it would report 26XX. This may explain the jump in score; but not sure what made it increase.

Give my numbers a try:

Min 2620

Max 2720 (I may have increased by 10)

Max out power slider.

Fast Timing on VRAM

2130 (increasing/decreasing subtracted from results)

MPT to increase power, I think I got it set to 289/345? Wattage usage goes up to 330. Any decrease to voltage (below 1150) makes it unstable.

I am on 32GB 3200CL16, I stuck 3600CL16 sticks in there but it would crash and I didn't bother playing with the numbers since the RAM RGB couldn't sync to the mobo.

Amd,I overpaid for a 3400g thinking 4750g pro was even if obiuslly more powerfull cpu wise not intended for gaming and mor.for.a ofice/workstation use ence the radeon on this apu it where less powerfull than in the 3400g,"Also tought that if not inferior in grafics wont be compatible with my tinny asrock deskmini x300. Since most videos and forums talked about the 3400g as the most powerfull grafic u can fit in the x300.
Now i know all 5his its quite the oposite, besides a way more powerfull cpu the ryzen pro 4750g sports much more powerfull graphics.
This where not such a mistake if i where paying 150 buck for the 3400g cuz the 4750g pro sell oem at 300 bucks.
But due the lack of stock and dificulty to find a 3400g i en paying 230 bucks plus 19 bucks of shipping since i had to buy it in another contry, also i had to wait week and a half cuz the international shipping, todsy i saw thr 4750g pro at 299buck in a store in my countr with 24/48h free shipping. Just for 50 buck more i could had my hands on a 30% more powerfull gsming rig gpu wise and literally double the cpu power. I cant return to the shity store (alternate) cuz rhe say they will take 5 weeks in reinbursing me and i have to pay for rhe shipping still.
Also the fact that the 3400g is boxed and the 4750g pro oem its not an advantage but a waste of money sin the stock fan that came with the boxed version dont fit in desk mine small form factor and i already purchased a low profile but powerfull (4 heatpipes) heat spreader/fan for 50 bucks ( i was plaing in oc it a bit).
So, how stupid you ppl think i am?, and taking in mind that i have no laptop or destop sin my dell xps13 died i can live one more day wiout my linux terminal... Do you think i should return the 3400g and wait 5 weeks to buy a 4750g pro? Giving the fack its not avaliable to the public and the store that sells it can run out of stock?
I plan to use as budget workstation and low en daming rig and emulation rig.

This are the parts and price i payed for each one, the free ones i recicled from my dead xps13 or a externa wd mypaspot thst now that i can i prefer to use it internall and bought a second identic one for 55e on amaxon second hand.

I’ve tried every troubleshooting step available including installing a clean version of windows 10 and downloading new drivers, bios, etc.,

Amd,"Windows 11 Megathread #2 - Build 22000.51 is live — Is my system compatible, TPM 2.0, Secure Boot and more","The first Insider Preview build of Windows 11, [build 22000.51](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/06/28/announcing-the-first-insider-preview-for-windows-11/) is now live for Windows Insiders on the Dev channel. For this specific build, no standalone ISO will be made available.

If you wish to learn more about the Windows Insider program and join, you can do so [here](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/)

Please remember, Windows 11 minimum requirements are subject to change and please do not install Windows Insider builds on a system where stability is crucial, only install on a system you are happy to wipe and reinstall at any moment.

The Windows 11 build 22000.51 via the Dev channel will only apply if you are running an AMD Ryzen 2nd Gen, or Intel 8th Gen or newer CPU.

There is a [workaround to this limit](https://mspoweruser.com/how-to-get-windows-11-dev-builds-if-your-pc-does-not-meet-minimum-hardware-criteria/), but please note, it is not known what, if any side effects may occur from doing this

Please use this thread to ask whether your system is compatible, for dedicated Windows 11 discussion, please use /r/Windows11 or /r/windowsinsiders

Here are the system requirements for Windows 11

---

* **Processor:** 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster with 2 or more cores on a compatible 64-bit processor or System on a Chip (SoC)

* **RAM:** 4 gigabyte (GB)

* **Storage:** 64 GB or larger storage device

* **System firmware:** UEFI, Secure Boot capable (for both GPU and Motherboard)

* **TPM:** Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 2.0

* **Graphics card:** Compatible with DirectX 12 or later with WDDM 2.0 driver

* **Display:** High definition (720p) display that is greater than 9” diagonally, 8 bits per color channel

* **Internet connection and Microsoft accounts:** Windows 11 Home and Windows 11 in S mode now require an internet connection during setup and require the use of a Microsoft Account, no more local (offline) accounts

---

For a list of other requirements, such as Auto HDR and DirectStorage, please see [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11-specifications)

The most important thing here, is Windows 11, at least the Insider Preview builds will *require* a UEFI system, with CSM disabled and they will require [TPM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/tpm/trusted-platform-module-overview) and [Secure Boot](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-secure-boot) to be enabled, Windows 10 and previous Windows Operating Systems have not had such stringent requirements.

Most modern AMD and Intel motherboards have some form of Firmware based TPM, which is different to Hardware based TPM solutions.

The first step you will want to do is make sure you are running the latest BIOS for your system.

---

**If you are using an AMD platform**, look for something called AMD fTPM or something similar, this can generally be found under the 'Security', 'Trusted Computing' or 'Advanced CPU settings' in most BIOSes.

**If you are using an Intel platform**, look for something called Intel IPT/PPT (Platform Trust Technology) or something similar, this can generally be found under the 'Security', 'Trusted Computing' or 'Advanced CPU settings' in most BIOSes.

---

TPM options are generally found in the same location as Secure Boot.

When enabling Secure Boot, you may have to set the key mode to Standard instead of Custom, before you can enable Secure Boot

When back in Windows, you can use Windows Key + R and type ""tpm.msc"", if it looks something [like this](https://imgur.com/a/O25oEi6), you are in business.

To check whether Secure Boot is enabled, you can open Windows Defender and go to Device Security, if you see [this at the bottom](https://imgur.com/a/kN85XEQ), it means you Secure Boot is enabled.

I looked up the fan ID and was able to find it on a Chinese website but the shipping will take approximately 1month. I don't want to wait that long so I'm looking for alternatives. I heard people will jerry-rig and attach fans with zipties. I'd still like to use the fan connector on the GPU so my question is; Can I plug in any GPU fan in there?

In fact I just found a new bug with this most recent release WHQL driver where it says it has saved but it hasn't. It's actually driving me insane.

For my wife I will just go with i5 11400 and 6700XT considering she only plays CSGO.

Amd,Question about minimum frequency (overclocking 6700 XT),"Hi all,

I picked up my new 6700 XT earlier in the week and am very pleased with my luck in binning - this reference model is able to hit 2.8 Ghz (actual clock, not in slider) stable at 1.11 V. Memory is at 2136 with fast timings.


My card came #1 in Fire Strike Extreme and Ultra Benchmarks, also only 3 other people beat me in time spy, and came #2 in port royal (had to downclock a bit to stay stable in port royal, sadly and I assume its a driver issue). 
These are all in comparison to other people with 2700X and 6700 XT. 

In Unigine Heaven, I got 105fps using 1440p extreme settings (vs. 93fps stock). I'm very happy to see this increase without the increase in temperatures thanks to undervolting.


I got one question, which is what should I do with the minimum clock slider? I don't like the idea of forcing my gpu to clock high when I don't need that power, but I'm curious if it will increase my benchmark scores. Any suggestions? 


Also any suggestions for how I could run Port royal at the clocks that are stable literally everywhere else? (including tests like MSI Kombustor)",False,33,0,1,0

Amd,My PC shutdown yesterday for the first time,"My PC (Ryzen 3600 + RTX 2060) shutdown yesterday for the first time. Apparently it was because high CPU temperatures.

I installed a Video converter application (EaseFab Video Converter) to convert some MKV files and apparently that converter wasn't using my GPU at all to encode and my CPU was 99% all the time during the conversion. I put the files to convert then proceeded to watch some youtube. My PC shutdown after 1-2 minutes.

Fortunately it turned on again and I immediately opened CPU-Z and start the conversion again to see what's happening. As soon as I clicked the convert button, my CPU temperatures starter Ryze-ing (sorry I had to do it) like crazy! In a few seconds the CPU temp hit 105 °C ! I immediately paused the conversion to let it cool off, and searched what's the max temp for a Ryzen 3600 and apparently it's 95 °C   [https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-5-3600](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-5-3600) I didn't want to melt my CPU so I deleted that converter.

I'm using the stock cooler and never had any issues with it. The CPU temps never hit even 90 °C. I guess that converter application was completely destroying the CPU. I immediately started searching for another converter that uses the GPU to encode and fortunately I found one. First of all, it's muuuch faster and the CPU is not perma 99%.

Now my question is = yeah, the video converter application was bad, but is my cooler also bad that it couldn't keep up with that? Like it was reaching 105 °C in matters of 15 seconds. Aren't CPU/fans designed to cool on max load and/or slow down a bit if the temperatures reach critical limits?? Why wasn't the CPU lowering it's power to be safe, but instead it just went ham until it shutdown....?

but about a month ago I started having random black screens playing any game after a few minutes.

 pc remains responsive with audio output but a black screen and video signal loss. only a reboot worked, the issue only appeared playing games.

 I tried everything in the book to fix the issue:  DDU, Older drivers, Newer drivers, Windows updates, Only drivers and no adrenalin, removing any third-party software,  full windows reinstall, no sauce. 

The Cause:

Placing my new gen 3(crucial p5) m.2 on the gen 4 slot of my  MSI b550 tomahawk.

I did this because I was migrating my windows from an older P1.

after fiddling with everything I changed the m.2 and placed it on the gen 3 slot and the issue went away.

Intel kinda sucks now. 

They've underdelivered, underperformed, and not innovated much in the gaming sector for sooooooooooooooome time now.

So lying flat down, I come to the painful conclusion, the me, an Intel stan needed to switch to AMD.  

And I'm moving as far away from them as possible by going full ryzen 9 5950x.

It feels so wrong but yet so good.

If I tried this out and tested it for a couple weeks, then switch back to non-overclocked state, would my warranty still be valid? If then sometime later a hardware failure would occur (non-overclocked) could I still hope for support?

So far I always assumed it works like this: If I ever start using the card outside of its specifications, a “switch” is flipped internally and everything’s counting as overclocked from here on. But is this really the case? Maybe someone has any experience regarding this topic?",False,7,0,1,0

Amd,Please help me decide with MoBo for 5600x. Agony of choise.,"Hello everyone. 
I'm going to finally update my CPU from current 6600k to 5600x. Choosing the CPU was the easiest part. Now I'm in the tough state of choosing a ""perfect"" motherboard for that. Other main specs are GTX 1070Ti and a 500W PSU (which I'm not willing to change right now)

Candidates:

At first I was totally sure about B550 and narrowed option to basically two motherboards

-Asus ROG Strix B550-F Gaming (Wi-Fi) - 156€ (currently on a discount until the end of a day. Usual price ~180€)

-GigaByte B550 Aorus Pro AC - 174€

And it's already a struggle to choose between them. My current board is Asus maximus and it's good, but i don't like the asus software. Second doubt about asus is vrm. However, at Hardware Unboxed temps are even better than gigabyte's

Then I started looking at X570. The reason is that in the future I'd like to get a second m2 ssd and i don't want to loose 2 sata ports, which is a usual thing with b550.

So, options here are:

-MSI MAG X570 Tomahawk WiFi - 210€

-GigaByte X570 Aorus Ultra - 233€

But that's already very expensive, especially gigabyte one. Unfortunately, there is no elite or pro with wifi in Europe. Also getting a x570 pro at 200 € doesn't make sense cause Bluetooth adapter will cost about 20-30€.

Psychologically it's very difficult to get an expensive mobo at a price almost equal to the price of cpu.

Which drives me to the idea do i really need those 2 sata ports? (Though currently I use all 6 of them)

I do plan to OC both cpu and ram, but nothing extreme.

What would you get on my place? Do i miss anything?

https://www.3dmark.com/compare/fs/25806744/fs/25775424

https://www.3dmark.com/compare/spy/21014607/spy/21134666

So these results might seem strange. Using an external display, I guess allowed some more power to the CPU, because it wasn't being used for the iGPU? Graphics performance seems identical / within the margin of error. 

As you approach higher resolutions, 4K, 1440p, ect, it matters less. At this point, most games on the internal screen already run well over 150FPS @ 1080p. With the GPU mostly maxed out too. 

But how does this translate to 1080p, since this thing has a 300HZ screen, a little more CPU headroom would surely help, right? And yes, it does, a good bit at least in Strange Brigade. 

https://i.imgur.com/13W0v8Y.png

I want you to keep in mind, these results seem really good, and would argue in favor of a mux - that Strange Brigade is amazingly well optimized for a title. You can see many benchmarks out there showcasing the ability for say, a 3080 to play it at 4K360HZ with almost no frame dips.  Not a lot of games are that well optimized. 

Now I was in a rush and will do more benchmarks of some other games tomorrow, the other one I did is FFXIV Shadowbringers, which is a MMORPG&lt; but has a good gamut of CPU bound and GPU bound scenarios due to that.

https://i.imgur.com/RredWdX.png

Both were run at ""Maximum"" settings. 

Now, according to ASUS, a Mux switch would've made them have to redesign their entire layout, and additional parts would've added another 200-250$ to the price. We see in this Laptops that cost far more than it already and it matches their performance even without a mux.  So yes, maybe ASUS should sell an Advantage+ Edition with one or something, but I am more than happy for a laptop under 1500$ to provide this kind of performance.

And if you wanna bitch about the poor stock RAM it comes with, know that Lenuvo is also doing it in their ""Pro"" lineup, while costing significantly more.

Now, if you're using this as a portable, due to lack of mux, the battery life is incredible. I can get almost 2 hours of medium gaming loads on the battery, and with keeping the refresh at 300. If I go to 60, even more.

Watching movies / TV shows it could last me 7-8 hours...but I run it at 90-100% brightness, keep that in mind. I also use MadVR, so it's using more than most people would when watching media. 

And if you're using this as a Desktop replacement, then the lack of a Mux Switch literally doesn't matter and you just saved yourself some good money. :P",False,31,0,1,0

But, in most cases, the 6900xt is around $1600 to 1700cad (probably i am sure Hashrate has something to do with it as well. ), the same scalper's price as an RTX 3070 triple fan. What's going on? The 6900xt is supposed to be on the same level as 3090? Is it because of DLSS? 

There is a youtube video about this, where a 3070 when DLSS is turned on, is on the same level as a 6900xt in FPS. Sometimes, being a little further ahead. 

I am no AMD or Nvidia fanboy, I just want the best bang for my buck. So my question is should I sell my 3070 in order to get the 6900xt for pretty much the same price? Or just stick with my 3070? 

On another quick note, the whole reason why I upgraded my PC is because of Red Dead 2, and DLSS is coming for this game.",False,45,0,1,0

I am not that quite familiar with tech and all and I want to ask for your insights on my problem.
We have the following:
-Acer Swift 3 - Ryzen 5 3500u laptop with 12gb ram(old)
-Acer Swift 3 - Ryzen 5 5500u laptop with 16gb ram (new)

We have an excel file with almost 10k rows and multiple sheets and inserting rows and columns is somewhat done instantly with CPU usage ranging from 30-40% during the insertion.
Meanwhile on our new laptop, running the same excel file and inserting rows and columns takes about 10secs-12secs to finish with 100% CPU usage during insertion.
Both have multithread option in excel enabled.

Amd,More FSR / TAAU / DOF Testing with KingsHunt - Detailed IQ Testing with all FSR / TAAU levels,"Hello, I made [this post 2 days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/o6skjq/digital_foundry_made_a_critical_mistake_with/) showing how Digital Foundries testing of KingsHunt was invalid.

Alex did reply, but sadly he didn't actually update the article images to include fixed ones with DOF properly disabled, since it is disabled on his TAAU screenshots which makes the game look much better as depth of field, even when disabled in options, blurs out the character, especially the lace dress.

I did make a mistake in my original post with the wrong scaling command for TAAU, which did make my resized TAAU incorrect (it was actually native rendering size) but the major bug being TAAU disables DOF was also validated when someone linked me to the developer of it on unreal forums: https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/gen-5-temporal-anti-aliasing/152107/5

So big thank you to /u/TechTuts and /u/KeinZantezuken for that (and many others for their *overall* kind comments).

&gt;&gt;  Out of curiosity, will the new TAA upscaling behave well with depth of field? Currently when you set r.TemporalAA.Upsampling=1 , most of the DOF just disappears.

&gt; **So when r.TemporalAA.Upsampling=1, it basically forces r.DOF.Recombine.Quality=0 that looses the slight DOF convolution**, and that is due to DiaphragmDOF.cpp’s bSupportsSlightOutOfFocus. There needs to have some changes in the handling of the slight out of convolution (about 5pixels and below) when doing temporal upsampling that I didn’t have time to come down to. And we were only using temporal upsampling on current gen consoles. **Wasn’t a big deal back then because if your frame would need to be temporally upsampled, that probably meant you didn’t have the performance to run DOF’s slight out of focus**… However we exactly ran into this issue for our Lumen in the Land of Nanite demo running on PS5, but it is still prototype and I’m not sure whether I’m gonna have this finished by 4.26’s release. But yeah given how temporal upsampling is going to become important, it’s definitely something to fix very high on the priority list. 

So basically its expected bug because if someone was using upscaling, they don't want a perf hit from DOF, at least when initially designed.

Here are all of the images in one album: https://imgur.com/a/2tfolwa

All screenshots are @ 3440x1440 with max settings except motion blur disabled and DOF disabled (though in game option doesn't actually disable it as you'll see).

Commands used:

```r.TemporalAA.Upsampling 1``` -- Enable TAAU - This disables FSR as well

```r.DepthOfFieldQuality 0``` -- Disable Depth of Field

```r.ScreenPercentage ###``` -- Set screen percentage. The game uses 77% for Ultra Quality, 67% for Quality, 58% for Balanced and 50% for Performance FSR modes (slider updates when you select). I used the same 4 + 100% for TAAU tests.

TAAU 58% (Balanced) | --- | https://i.imgur.com/5fFmHZB.jpg
TAAU 50% (Performance) | --- | https://i.imgur.com/fRRscfe.jpg

I didn't do all the TAAU w/DOF setting enabled since it doesn't make a difference when comparing 100% on vs off and would have just taken more time. As you can see there is no performance difference when disabling it vs disabling it for all other tests. I'd also bumped the mouse and had to re-position it and its slightly off for the last few TAAU tests and the bonus tests.

And for a bonus I did renderScale 120 for FSR UQ and Native, I don't think it actually scaled properly but it did do the sharpening pass for FSR

120% FSR UQ: https://i.imgur.com/u6pC45n.jpg

120% Native: https://i.imgur.com/AIe7TYC.jpg

From the performance being basically equal (it fluctuates few fps) I don't think the ""UQ"" part of FSR was applied at all, which would have scaled it down to 92% or so, so would want to test that in the future with a 100% FSR vs 100% Native as well. I'm glad games like DOTA are allowing users to pick the exact scaling values, excited to see more games integrate that, and hopefully a sharpening slider as well.

Anyway, I hope this helps to clear up any misunderstandings from my first post. I had thrown in FSR / TAAU comparisons quickly but was mostly trying to point out that DOF was broken when TAAU was enabled. Unfortunately Digital Foundries while acknowledging that their testing was flawed, did not correct it, and even originally posted Godfall photos that were also flawed before people called them out on it on twitter. I hope Alex or someone else from Digital Foundries fully corrects the article with updated KingsHunt images and uploads a new video correcting it as well, DOF makes a massive difference in image quality in this game (no clue *why* the devs have the main character out of focus, their lace texture is ruined and it costs performance!).

Another note regarding performance, that would need to be tested for longer, as there is quite a swing in fps while just standing still, the fire/wall effect on the left side of the screen is likely the cause as it is what is changing the most. So while FPS is displayed, it would need to be captured for a while and averaged out to really compare performance between any of the modes as it did swing +- 5-10fps or so.",False,129,0,1,0
Amd,I'm very disappointed in AMD...,"I've an old HD7790 (R7-260X) which AMD recently axed, unfortunately. Well, I can't complain much (unlike R9 Fury owners) considering the card is (was) a rival of 650Ti; and in extension just a tad bit faster than the humble GT1030. 

My biggest concern is Windows 11 support on Adrenalin 21.5.2, the last driver update it'll ever receive. On the driver page it says: 

&gt;""*This product has been moved to a legacy support model and no additional driver releases are planned.*"".

Which practically means it's not going to get any support for Windows 11, despite native DirectX 12 support. Meanwhile Kepler, GCN 1-2.0's archrival, is most definitely going to receive an update for Windows 11 as it'll be axed later this year (October) but is seems like AMD users are **ROYALLY** screwed, especially R9 Fury owners?

What shady practice is this?

First, I'd to deal with the diminishing performance with each driver update and now I'll have to deal with this too?!

Plus there's this: 

&gt;*""For users passionate about gaming, you may wish to consider upgrading to a modern GPU and benefit from exciting new features, improved performance, lower power consumption and broader compatibility with the latest PC games. For information about current graphics products and where to buy, please visit:* *AMD Radeon™ RX Graphics Cards**.""*

D!ck move, AMD. I'd the option to choose either the 650Ti or HD7790 but I chose the later because of all the voltage and p-state tweaks AMD offers (I love to play around with voltages) + the card **natively** supports DirectX 12 which was a huge deal in the early 2010s but now I'm starting to regret my decision.

Maybe I'm being a d!ck too, bickering about a vintage low-end product that the company supported for like 7-8 years but again, what if I was a Fury owner? Don't you think AMD should've waited just a few days for Windows 11 before pulling the plug on GCN 1.0 - 3.0? I think that's a fair expectation.

Amd,3700x vs 5600x for gaming now and in the future?,"I know this has probably been asked many times, but it’s been a while since I’ve built a PC for myself and would like to hear your opinions.

Given that the new consoles have processors nearly equivalent to a 3700x, would 8 cores and 16 threads be optimal for the future? I know that the previous gen had 8 cores also, but quad core Intel CPUs could out do the shitty Jaguars. I feel like having decent 8 core CPUs now may lead to proper optimisation for all of said cores in future games.

Which is why I’m worried about buying the faster CPU with less cores. Im not sure if that’s going to be a viable strategy moving forward.

For reference I’m looking at pairing with a 6700xt.

Lowering the offset to 25 and 20 gives basically the same performance and power consumption. With the offset at 15 it also gets the same performance but power consumption is &lt;180W, with it randomly jumping to 200W mid-run every time.

I've been tracking the core clocks in HWiNFO64 and running the offset at 30 gives 4750MHz on all cores, but the end result is similar if not lower than running the offset at 15 and getting 4575MHz on all cores. What am I doing wrong here?",False,2,0,1,0

Amd,The economic incentive of FidelityFX Super Resolution adoption in older games without microtransactions.,"Hello,

(this is my first post in Reddit)

&amp;#x200B;

The release of FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) is certainly great news for gamers, as the compatibility with older gpus reveal itself far more wide than what AMD has claimed in the beginning. This may have to be with some point of diminishing returns as Frank Azor stated in an interview  with The Full Nerd. Anyway, it remains to be seen where the limit of adoption will finally land, but this open a new question regarding the incorporation of the technology in older games. There is a good amount of great, not so old games, that could potentially benefit with the adoption of FSR, and that now could be played (or played at higher resolutions/details) in lower end hardware. I'm thinking in The Witcher 3, Doom 2016, Wolfenstein The New Order, just for naming a few. The question is, would the current selling price of this games be enough incentive to developers to adopt FSR, in older games that lack of microtransactions? If is not, the owners of older hardware could be missing a great opportunity for playing again (or playing for the first time) these games. There are two possible solutions I can think right now (my background is in economics):

1) The adoption comes in the form of an expansion for the game that you can buy. This would be the ""market solution"".

&amp;#x200B;

2) The adoption comes as the community request to developers that certain games be included, this giving the signal to them that there is hidden demand for it. Although is still a market solution, it has more community elements and adds no new costs.

 

All of this also has to do with the poll AMD made, requesting gamers to reveal their preferences. **The publication of the results could be a toll for the community** in the second solution proposed. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for me, I game in Linux... but, how knows when fate could surprise you.

Amd,Overclocking - 5950x - Ryzen Master EDC limit somehow better than BIOS,"Hi everyone, I discovered something super weird today when attempting to do a bit of overclocking. If I run Cinebench R23 with just PBO enabled in my BIOS and everything else stock my Cinebench score floats between 27.5k to 28k. The PBO enabling gives me the following - 140A TDC and 215A EDC. However when I drop my EDC on Ryzen Master to 150A I can get a Cinebench score of 28.5k. 

So naturally I went to the BIOS to set the EDC to 150A and TDC to 140A manually so I wouldn't have to use Ryzen Master every time. However now my TDC only hits about 92% (i.e it doesn't hit 140A TDC anymore) and I end up with a Cinebench score of about 24k. It's definitely not my PPT that's a problem.

So for some reason I need to set the 140A TDC and 150A EDC limit on Ryzen Master to get that performance boost.

Has anyone experienced something this weird with Ryzen Master? I'm left with two choices - enable just PBO and move on with life, or always use Ryzen Master on startup to get that extra 2% (probably will drive me nuts long term).",False,5,0,1,0

Amd,"Windows 11 Megathread - Is my system compatible, TPM, Secure Boot and more","Earlier today, [Microsoft announced Windows 11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh9643c2P6k), it brings many new features, such as Auto HDR, DirectStorage, as well as a UI overhaul.

Please use this thread to ask whether your system is compatible, for dedicated Windows 11 discussion, please use /r/Windows11

Windows 11 will be coming to Windows Insiders on the Dev ring sometime next week and will be releasing to everyone else later in the year.

Here are the system requirements for Windows 11

---

* **Processor:** 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster with 2 or more cores on a compatible 64-bit processor or System on a Chip (SoC)

* **RAM:** 4 gigabyte (GB)

* **Storage:** 64 GB or larger storage device

* **System firmware:** UEFI, Secure Boot capable

* **TPM:** Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 2.0

* **Graphics card:** Compatible with DirectX 12 or later with WDDM 2.0 driver

* **Display:** High definition (720p) display that is greater than 9” diagonally, 8 bits per color channel

* **Internet connection and Microsoft accounts:** Windows 11 Home and Windows 11 in S mode now require an internet connection during setup and require the use of a Microsoft Account, no more local (offline) accounts

---

For a list of other requirements, such as Auto HDR and DirectStorage, please see [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11-specifications)

The most important thing here, is Windows 11, at least the Insider Preview builds will *require* a UEFI system, with CSM disabled and they will require TPM and Secure Boot to be enabled, Windows 10 and previous Windows Operating Systems have not had such stringent requirements.

Most modern AMD and Intel motherboards have some form of Firmware based TPM, which is different to Hardware based TPM solutions.

The first step you will want to do is make sure you are running the latest BIOS for your system.

If you are using an AMD platform, look for something called AMD fTPM or something similar, this can generally be found under the 'Security', 'Trusted Computing' or 'Advanced CPU settings' in most BIOSes.

If you are using an Intel platform, look for something called Intel IPT/PPT or something similar, this can generally be found under the 'Security', 'Trusted Computing' or 'Advanced CPU settings' in most BIOSes.

TPM options are generally found in the same location as Secure Boot.

When enabling Secure Boot, you may have to set the key mode to Standard instead of Custom, before you can enable Secure Boot

When back in Windows, you can use Windows Key + R and type ""tpm.msc"", if it looks something [like this](https://imgur.com/a/O25oEi6), you are in business.

To check whether Secure Boot is enabled, you can open Windows Defender and go to Device Security, if you see [this at the bottom](https://imgur.com/a/kN85XEQ), it means you Secure Boot is enabled.

Amd,"Hey AMD, just for the record, some of us would really dig it if you could use FSR for dynamic downsampling when we have performance headroom.","FSR is a *performance enhancer,* basically, we trade a bit of visual fidelity, in the form of resolution, in exchange for a few more frames per second, and I totally dig that, because I have a hard time capping out my framerate these days.  (Vega 64, 1440p@144hz, by the way.)  
  
But some people have absolutely *beastly* systems, stuff that can hit that 120hz or 144hz or 240hz mark with ease, and for those folks, it seems to me, FSR could be used as an *image enhancement* feature.  

Stick with me here:  FSR says ""Okay, this game is playing at 30fps@100% resolution scaling, so let's turn the resolution scaling down to 75% and bump the fps up to 50fps.""  What if it could *also* say ""Okay, this game is playing at 144fps@100% resolution, so let's turn the resolution scaling *up* to 115%, and reduce the fps by nothing.""  
  
See what I'm getting at?  
  
I mean obviously right now AMD should be focused on maximizing performance, since that the *whole point* of FSR, I'm just saying that someday, AMD, if you get the time, a lot of us would really dig having an option for dynamic super sampling/resolution.  
  
Some games don't take a ton of horsepower to run, so AMD should use that extra performance headroom for image enhancements.  Anyone else with me?  Does that sound like a feature that you'd like to have, or maybe actually use, if it was well implemented?",False,22,0,1,0

Amd,I was able to reproduced random black screen issues where there were none before,"I recently transferred to a small form factor case. I had 4 sticks of crucial 16gb ballistix 3200mhz ram installed in my old system. These were 2 kits bought separately.

I grabbed 2 sticks from that build and tossed them into my new ITX board and completed the build. After booting and installing drivers and stuff, my 6900xt would randomly black screen, or the driver would crash mid game.

I knew it wasn't the card because it worked fine in my last build. The old psu was a 750 watt and the new one was 850 watts; so I knew it wasn't the PSU. So had to be something else.

I remembered reading about all the black screen problems people were having and remembered most people saying it was RAM compatibility problems and sure enough it turned out to be that I had mixed the kits together.

So despite these sticks being the exact same brand, frequency and timing, they caused all sorts of issues with the card. Goes to show that a lot of these driver problems can definitely be due to RAM instability. Nvidia drivers must be far more error tolerant, or maybe it can be said that AMD drivers are operating on a knife's edge in terms of optimizing and error recovery.",False,7,0,1,0

2020,before the price of GPUs go any higher i rushed to get me a new PC just in time and this time i went from an I7 6700K, geforce 970, to a Ryzen 7 5800X and a radeon 6900XT(Heat in of the moments, would've settled with 6800XT instead but that mean an Nvidia GPU would've been better at the same pricetag).

I was faced with multiple problems:-

-RAM was not the right type(shopkeeper fault, got a free replacement of 48GB which is Neat i guess).
-mobo Bios was Kaput causing multiple problem untill it was reinstalled(shopkeeper installed initially).
-Steam software Screenshot folder is a mess, no photo is in an Assign folder
-AMD adrenaline has been causing me multiple problem including my media folder is not well organised like my Geforce experiance folder.

Amd,Digital Foundry made a critical mistake with their Kingshunt FSR Testing - TAAU apparently disables Depth of Field. Depth of Field causes the character model to look blurry even at Native settings (no upscaling),"I noticed in the [written guide](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2021-amd-fidelity-fx-super-resolution-fsr-performance-wins-but-what-about-image-quality) they put up that they had a picture of 4k Native, which looked just as blurry on the character's textures and lace as FSR upscaling from 1080p. So FSR wasn't the problem, and actually looked very close to Native.

Messing around with [Unreal Unlocker](https://framedsc.github.io/GeneralGuides/universal_ue4_consoleunlocker.htm#downloading-the-unlocker). I enabled TAAU (```r.TemporalAA.Upsampling 1```) and immediately noticed that the whole character looked far better and the blur was removed.

Native: https://i.imgur.com/oN83uc2.png

TAAU: https://i.imgur.com/L92wzBY.png

I had already disabled Motion Blur and Depth of Field in the settings but the image still didn't look good with TAAU off.

I started playing with other effects such as ``` r.PostProcessAAQuality``` but it still looked blurry with TAAU disabled. I finally found that ```sg.PostProcessQuality 0``` made the image look so much better... which makes no sense because that is *disabling* all the post processing effects!

So one by one I started disabling effects, and ```r.DepthOfFieldQuality 0``` was the winner.. which was odd because I'd already disabled it in the settings.

So I restarted the game to make sure nothing else was conflicting and to reset all my console changes, double checked that DOF was disabled, yet clearly still making it look bad, and then did a quick few tests

Native (no changes from UUU): https://i.imgur.com/IDcLyBu.jpg

Native (```r.DepthOfFieldQuality 0```): https://i.imgur.com/llCG7Kp.jpg

FSR Ultra Quality (```r.DepthOfFieldQuality 0```): https://i.imgur.com/tYfMja1.jpg

TAAU (```r.TemporalAA.Upsampling 1``` and ```r.SecondaryScreenPercentage.GameViewport 77```): https://i.imgur.com/SPJs8Xg.jpg

As you can see, FSR Ultra Quality looks better than TAAU for the same FPS once you force disable DepthOfField, which TAAU is already doing (likely because its forced not directly integrated into the game).

But don't take my word for it, test it yourself. I've given all the tools and commands you need to do so.

Hopefully the devs will see this and make the DOF setting work properly, or at least make the character not effected by DOF because it really kills the quality of their work!

Amd,Me trying to figure out if an upgrade to 1440p from 1080p is now worth it with FSR. (Native 1080 vs 1440 FSR comparison),"Feel like no one usually does this comparison, so I had to. Most do Native 1440p vs 1440p FSR.

[5 different comparison of zoomed in images taken on my brother 1440p monitor vs my 1080p: The Riftbreaker has a free demo withy FSR so I used that.](https://imgur.com/a/qmr5fmX)

I'd like to upgrade to a 1440p monitor, but I wasn't sure if it was worth it with the performance loss. I'm only looking at image quality right now without looking at the difference between monitors. I realize that some of the image tech in current 1440p monitors might look better than my older 1080p panel, but I don't want to factor that in right now.

Running things at your monitors native resolution will always show a quality gain, and I'm curious if it's even worth upgrading. I tried ordering images from what I think looks best to worst. I'm a little bit torn. 

\-Ultra Quality FSR at 1440p is probably slightly better than a native 1080p image with Sharpening on a 1080p display, but I also ***loose*** roughly 5% performance.

\-Quality FSR at 1440p is comparable to 1080p with Sharpening on a 1080p display, and I ***gain*** around 5% FPS. The fact the 1080p Sharpened image is running natively on my display does sometimes kind of make it look a bit better in my opinion, but it's a tossup.

I would like to be able to manually tune Sharpening on top of FSR like shown in this previous post [https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/o60bcc/psareshade\_cas\_improves\_fsr\_dramatically/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/o60bcc/psareshade_cas_improves_fsr_dramatically/)

but until I get an AMD GPU again to force RIS in the control panel, I'm not so sure it's actually worth upgrading.

The thing they are missing however, is that while FSR is a great alternative to traditional upscaling, 95% of modern AAA games don't use such techniques anymore. They use temporal upsampling which far out does FSR as discussed by digital foundry. New games like COD, Battlefield, Fortnite, Metro etc. will not benefit at all from FSR as they are already using a better method for upsampling. I'm excited to see FSR implemented in older/indie games that don't have access to more advanced temporal techniques but for the vast majority of modern AAA releases FSR serves no purpose. Alex from digital foundry mentioned this on Twitter when someone asked whether companies like insomniac would get any benefit from FSR.

&gt; ###How it works

&gt; FidelityFX Super Resolution is a spatial upscaler: it works by taking the current anti-aliased frame and upscaling it to display resolution without relying on other data such as frame history or motion vectors.

&gt; At the heart of FSR is a cutting-edge algorithm that detects and recreates high-resolution edges from the source image. Those high-resolution edges are a critical element required for turning the current frame into a “super resolution” image. 
FSR provides consistent upscaling quality regardless of whether the frame is in movement, which can provide quality advantages compared to other types of upscalers.

&gt; FSR is composed of two main passes:

&gt; * An upscaling pass called EASU (Edge-Adaptive Spatial Upsampling) that also performs edge reconstruction. In this pass the input frame is analyzed and the main part of the algorithm detects gradient reversals – essentially looking at how neighboring gradients differ – from a set of input pixels. The intensity of the gradient reversals defines the weights to apply to the reconstructed pixels at display resolution.

&gt; * A sharpening pass called RCAS (Robust Contrast-Adaptive Sharpening) that extracts pixel detail in the upscaled image.",False,22,0,1,0

Amd,Little bit of a vent.... but do your homework when buying a prebuilt.,"Spent most of the night trying to sort out some performance issues on his pc. He's been complaing to me that he keeps getting random lag spikes with really high cpu times and very low fps. So we hop in a discord and he screen shre3s with and shows his task manger and his i7 -9700f. Is running at 2.8ghz. I know base clock is 3.00, we'll get to that in a few. So must be a bios setting right.  Have him reboot and I go look up the manuall for his Asus Tuf H365m and there's nothing in the manual about what the bios has to offer. Just EzMode and Advanced...great. I know nothing.....nothing...about Intel. Been an AMD fanboy since I built a K62 in high school. So we stumbling through I find Turbo Boost Mode was disabled. He's had the pc for about a year now he got from IbuyPower...it's been disabled this whole time. He's not a very tech savy kid. He didn't even know about he bios. I believe IbuyPower set it that way to limit the power. They installed a aluminum tiny little cooler. It looks like an cheap intel one but off brand. It's way to small for a i7. So we get that on, back to Windows Task Mgr shows boost speeds...So he tries the game and she got right up to about 99 degrees when he pulled the plug. 

So I figured with that small cooler it just couldn't handle normal boost  settings. So messing around in Intel XTU. I tried playing wit hthe PL1, PL2, Turbo time. Nothing made a difference. The best I could do was drop the PL1 watts down pretty low that it Power limited. So I stumbled across ThrottleStop. Reset what I messed with in XTU and tried setting a voltage offset and dropping the boost clocks from 47 to 45 and lower for the other cores following the same pattern that was set. It works. Using the stress test in ThrottleStop. All cores boosted to 4.5 temps were down around 60-65c. Awesome.  So trying to tweak the settings back the other way to see if I could get the performance up just a bit the pc crashes...strange..so reset Throttlestop.ini and boot back into windows Im dumbfounded...my best guess that I could tell the kid is his cooolers just too weak. So for shits and giggles I have him go back in to the bios and I find a seeting Cpu Performance Enhancer in A.I Tweaker. I missed it in the first time in the bios. I look it up and come to find out it was set to auto and was overriding the max boost clocks and tyring to do an all core 4.7ghz  turbo boost. What the fuck. Disable that...Set the Turbo boost  settings all back to default. Fuck it.  fuck stressing it...Go right into MW. cpus sitting at 75c and he's estatic.

Between the terrible lack of information Asus provided about the bios, and Intel's odd way of trying to turbo boost and Asus's attempt at trying to oc. That was the worst experience I've ever had trying to diagnose some thing. I don't have proof that IbuyPower disabled Turbo Boost but it sure looks like it and that's a real scummy way of trying to sell performance while lowering cost's is sly sneaky ways. I'm sorry for the rant. It was my first time ever dealing an Intel Cpu. It will definitly also be my last  by choice. I'll help who ever I can but fuck Intel. AMD rules!",False,1,0,1,0

Amd,Really thinking about switching to AMD from Intel - a couple of noob questions,"Hey, I have a really old setup (GTX 960 and i5 4460), and while its still works I think the time to build new setup has come. For the past month I've been reading and watching everything that I could to understand what I can get to create a new setup for another at least 4 years (probably more) and at first I was thinking about going with Intel, then I thought maybe it would be better to wait for next gen + DDR5, but I feel that will be hella pricey and not that great at first so I finally decided that let's build a new PC this year and the more I've read about it the more it looked like that the AMD cpus are the better option. So, I'm 99% sure that I'll be buying AMD but I have a couple of questions, because the more I read it, the more my brain hurts.

* I'm planning to get 5600x because I only game and work as programmer so I don't the extra power of 5800x but I'm wrong here and it's bettee to get the 5800x? Especially if I'm planning to use this setup for another at least 4 years and you never know what thw future will bring, maybe I'll start to need that extra power from CPU?

* X570 or B550 - the same question that everyone have. At first I was planning to get X570 MSI Tomahawk (after watching JayzTwoCents video about that topic), but then I started to read more about it (on this subreddit too) and it looks like that people recommended to go with B550 but the posts that I've saw about it were from a couple of months ago, but maybe something changed about it since then? I'm using 2 SSD Sata drives, some time later on will add first m2 drive, and I would like to have a a space for an upgrade later on to add a second m2 drive.

* I've seen so many different opinions about getting a CPU cooler for 5600x that now I'm not sure what's the best thing to buy/do. Should I go with AIO, air or just stick with the stock cooler? 

* And just to be sure: I'm planning to get 850W PSU from Corsair (I think it's called 850x something something), will that be enough for 5600x and for the rest of components that I'll use for this setup (2x16GB 3600Mhz RAM, 2x sata drives, 1x m2 drive, RTX 3080 and CPU cooler of some sort)?",False,20,0,1,0

I installed everything and it seems to be working properly except for the temperatures. I'm idling at around 55-60 doing nothing, under load it can go up to 65-70. Occasionally it'll go up as high during extreme load to 79 and hover there.

Changing fan to blast at 100% seems to not really do much to the temps itself as much as I am used to seeing so I'm starting to suspect the mounting kit to be bad. Before I order a new cooler, I wanted to see if it'd be a waste of money. I read people get 30's idling and I kind of want that as well.

Essentially, you need to turn on VSR or DSR and then go to the in-game graphics settings and turn up the resolution beyond your native display resolution.

The Riftbreaker: Prologue Demo is also free Steam:

[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1293860/The\_Riftbreaker\_Prologue/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1293860/The_Riftbreaker_Prologue/)

I think that using VSR or DSR is a pretty viable option for people that want to use FSR with 1080p monitors. While the performance uplift is not as much, it is way better than not using FSR at all. I will happily give away some of the 40% FPS uplift to get better image quality and still have better performance (29%) than native 1080p.

Amd,Prefix's rundown of FSR vs DLSS differences,"Here are my opinions on the differences between FSR vs DLSS

_________

Pros of DLSS  vs FSR
Handles TAA shimmering better than FSR  
Standing still images often look a bit better. And text on billboards actually looks fantastic


_____________

Cons of DLSS vs FSR

GPU support limited to RTX cards  
Moire effect is common  
Ghosting is very common in motion  


Motion in general is worse

_________

Other differences on FSR vs DLSS

DLSS handles Shimmering from TAA better removing some shimmering, however DLSS adds shimmering to some objects that don't normally shimmer. In any game that isn't TAA always on this is a downside to DLSS however in games with TAA as optional or not on this is a downside.


FSR looks kinda bad on the highest performance modes compared to DLSS highest performance modes. Ultra Quality on FSR looked better than Quality from DLSS imo though.

Game support is higher on DLSS right now however most games have pretty meh implementations. Also FSR is much easier to add to a game and its expected to have more game support eventually especially considering consoles will support it.

HOWEVER there has been a huge push in last 3 months from nvidia getting DLSS support in games so its not likely going to just die out too fast. If Nvidia continues their partnership to get RTX in more games it might take a while for FSR to take off so even though most people expect FSR to win overall in game support this could possibly take maybe even years before its actually the case so keep this in mind that buying gpu's for possible future support is always a gamble.

____


I am going to expand further on FSR that many people don't actually fully grasp supporting older hardware and explain something.

Certain DLSS titles like Rainboy 6 Siege and F1 added DLSS support but even the lowest end RTX card the 2060 can get over 100fps at 4k native in these titles. These 2 games its crazy that no RTX card would ever want to turn it on but maybe someone on a 1060 or something could benefit.

IMO you should never use DLSS in an FPS because the ghosting will ruin your aim however DLSS could be better for certain games  like a turn based strategy game where small tiny objects could preserve smaller details better and u don't have fast moving objects.

I personally cannot stand ghosting so I would never ever enable DLSS under any circumstances but this is my personal opinion some people don't mind ghosting for extra FPS.",False,27,0,1,0

Amd,AMD moving Bristol Ridge (2016) support to legacy should make you wary of buying Cezanne APUs with Vega graphics,"Bristol Ridge has been sold since September 2016 in OEM PCs and since July 2017 in the DIY market.

In 2021, support for these APUs - if you run Windows - is now legacy and will not receive graphics driver feature/performance updates. Clearly, Polaris and Vega are on the chopping block next. Given how AMD previously moved GPUs to legacy in 2009, 2012, and 2015, a pessimistic estimate is that 3 years of life are left in the Cezanne Vega iGPU before it moves to legacy. Bristol Ridge had 4.7 years, and just under 4 if you count from DIY launch.

Amd,FidelityFX SR is a Boss-Move by AMD,"Had to say this, as someone who still owns a (2nd) computer with a 10-Series Nvidia GPU and also knowing many friends with ""older"" AMD GPUs. 

The fact that they're offering this for a fairly wide variety of GPUs, especially older ones and than it's not even limited to AMD only ... 

This has a bigger impact, many might not even think about! Nvidia launched a very well price-2-perfomance GPU and AMD, after years and years of lagging behind now is an actual competition in the higher end, what an amazing year for gamers, right? If only there wasn't all these other things going around, Rona, Silicon shortage, crypto etc etc. And the fact that FidelityFX SR supports RX-500 and GTX 10-Series GPUs gives the people with these a little bit of extra juice before they too might be able to finally get one of the new cards for MSRP

Amd,FSR works on pretty much everything,"I didn't test it on everything, or anything beyond one system, but I did install the Riftbreaker demo on my old XPS 13 which has a Core i5 6200U with HD Graphics 520, and FSR worked. I was able to choose any present at any of the available resolutions.

At 1080p native with the lowest graphical settings the game runs (I just looked at the opening scene, didn't get into it) at about 11 FPS, with FSR Quality at around 15 FPS and FSR Performance at 17 FPS. Native 720p runs at 17 FPS. The 3D scene at 720p looks better than 1080p Performance, but the UI for FSR is at 1080p which is definitely noticeable. My choice of these would be FSR Quality, which is 720p upscaled and looks quite good, with 1080p UI.

I also ran at 720p with FSR Performance, and it looked like crap but ran at around 23 FPS. The game itself doesn't go much lower than 720p, so that kind of performance is only available with FSR. It might look like crap because it's rendering at 640x360, but it looks like crap with a 720p UI, so it should be at least somewhat playable.

Short of it is, I feel that FSR fulfills our hopes or giving some more life to weak hardware.",False,0,0,1,0

Currently in running a 4790k with 16Gb 1333MHz ddr3 ram and really wanting to upgrade to the 5800x. As you can see I don't frequently my pc components as I don't see the point in upgrading with every generation to get minimal performance benefits, but if thats you then crack on.

My question is, should i hold out and wait until the AM5 cpus and boards and get the bigger performance benefits over ddr4/AM4 or should i just bite the bullet and upgrade now. 

As far as im aware, i believe that its due to realise within the next 12 months but im scared of price/reliability upon launch as well as having to replace the entire chipset should i want to upgrade sooner rather than later.

any comments are appriciated. Thanks!",False,34,0,1,0

Amd,Zen3 is it possible to manually set idle and PBO max clocks?," Hi.

I have a Ryzen 5800x and I have two questions:

1. Is  there a way to reduce idle clocks? It drops to 3600 on idle, but is it  possible to change idle clock to lower value, like 3200 or 3000.  
Don't think it will make a difference for me, because it rises them anyway as soon as there is any real task to performs.
2. Is it possible to reduce PBO upper clock?  
This is VERY nitpicky (almost OCD-ish). It rumps up to 4850 MHz on full load on one core and I want more ""round"" value.  
I've  tried to rise it to 4900 with PBO2, but for that I need to sacrifice my  Curve Optimizations, so if there is a way to ""cut"" 50 Mhz it would be  nice. It's not like they would really affect performance and multi-core  load is far from reaching it anyway.",False,15,0,1,0

Ram - Corsair 32GB 3200 C16 (CMK32GX4M2B3200C16)

\*never OC'd, only XMP turned on

**Issue**

Started observing random BSOD and hard reboot (almost always overnight when I leave it on to do low load work such as download and/or automation task)  
I then turned off XMP, and observed same result  
I then did a clean Windows 10 Pro install and observed same result

**Diagnostic**

Memtest86 pass repeatedly (both XMP on and off)  
OCCT pass for free 1 hour test (both XMP on and off)  
Linpack Xtreme found no issue 1+ hour (XMP off, haven't tried XMP on)  
Prime95. This is where I can get a consistent failure.  
Ran PSU and GFX on another old Intel/DDR3 system on a Ubuntu USB boot, no issue with Prime95 over 8+hours on blend  
Ran on original system on same Ubuntu USB boot, same failure with Prime95 as observed in Windows

**Prime95 Failure**

Blend will always produce failure on Worker #3 or #4. Sometime after long enough, it will fail both and Ryzen Master will show Core 2 idle.  
Large FFT test also produces the same result consistently.  
Other FFT settings seems to be less consistent so far, sometime it'll be fine for a long time, sometimes not and always fail on the same Core.  
A strange thing is, I noticed sometime it'll fail Worker #3 immediately on stress start and almost always it'll fail consistently around 1hour 40min into the test when it's doing ""Self-test 896k""

**Fix Attempt**

Bump SoC voltage in 0.0125v increment offset. All same result. I stopped at 0.05v  
Bump VRAM voltage in 0.01v increment from 1.35v. All same result. I stopped at 1.38v

**Contact with AMD/Retailer**

I contacted AMD describing my issue. They told me to update BIOs to beta and give that a try, this resulted in same outcome. They then told me it'll be easier to contact retailer for warranty otherwise I have to pay shipping to Singapore... (I'm located in Australia)  
I contacted my retailer (Computer Alliance from QLD, Australia) and they told me to ship CPU/RAM/Mobo to them so they can test it out. They told me they couldn't reproduce the error and said it might be my PSU or GFX... (I'm a bit surprised they said it might be GFX when I described my consistent failure in Prime95... They used a generic 550w PSU and a GTX 1660), so they sent it back. I immediately was able to reproduce the issue again...

&amp;#x200B;

I've now purchased a new SF750 and will be trying that out when it arrives (although I'm skeptical since PSU and GFX is rock solid with an old Intel/DDR3).

Not sure what else I can try... I don't have a spare CPU/Ram/Mobo that I can try...",False,2,0,1,0

Amd,CPPC tags.,"Do the CPPC tags for 1 chip relate to their performance against another chip?  I have had a 5600x a 5900x and now a 5950x.  With PBO boost turned on the 5900x has cppc tags from 181 to 164 on ccx1 and 160 to 139 on ccx2.  The 5600X has cppc tags in the same range as ccx2 on the 5900.  The 5950X has scores from 212 to 190 on ccx1 and 186 to 153 on ccx2.  I know that the 59xx chips always have a premium sample for ccx1 and I have been told both are premium on 5950x.  

Going off my experience with this one it's def a great sample, whereas my 5900x wasn't anything special but could hit the high benchmarks with the right amount of voltage.  So I am guessing that the higher cppc tag indicates the chip can hit its peak speeds at a lower voltage.  641 is the best single core cb20 score I can get so far with any ryzen 3.  With my new 5950x I only peaked at 1.43v to get that score and the avg v for the top 2 cores was much lower.  I think 641 is the best score I've had on all 3 chips so far but the voltage I needed was higher.

So does anyone want to share their cppc tags?  Anyone have a chip with unusually high or low ones?  I have noticed that the ranges are similar a lot of times in the diff chips.  I have also seen 5900x chips with cppc tags in the 200's.  So I want to see what people think of the scores and how they reflect the quality of the chip.",False,6,0,1,0

Of course I cheaped out and got an AMD A4 5300B for $17 but that CPU is proven to be too slow for gaming in a lot of games and is a major bottleneck. So I wanted to upgrade this part to a faster CPU but I am stumped on what options are worth it.

The Ryzen APUs are a whole lot better (even the Ryzen-based Athlons trounces the A4 5300B) but it would cost far more for even the cheapest Ryzen APU since the cost of the motherboard and RAM would have to be considered. So this leaves me capped with the APUs supported on my current motherboard for budget reasons at the moment. Which CPU/APU would be a better fit, the AMD A10 7860K, A10 7700K or A8 7600? The A8 7600 is generally found cheap but I am not sure what the performance difference is between an A10 7860K, 7700K and 7600 on the CPU side of things, seems like most of the difference is in the integrated GPU size.",False,2,0,1,0

So I get in the ring and the new system build fight starts: 

first blow is landed on myself, after a day of installation nothing happens when I turn on the system, it takes me a while to figure out that some moron decided all the mobo cables couldnt be put in one cable and there are two more connections on the mobo ""for the CPU"". 

Anyway, next blow is landed by Microsoft -- Windows 7 ""no can do"" AMD 5950x, so now I have to install Windows 10, I am a bit stunned, but... okay, I can handle that.

Now AMD lands the knockout punch -- no video card driver -- AMD recommended, latest driver, an old version 18.2.1, not even the version installed by Windows during OS installation (the OS somehow realizes it and uninstalls that driver itself) is compatible with my system none of these drivers either installs correctly or allows my computer to run more than a few seconds before crashing. 

So I am stuck on ""Microsoft Basic Display Adapter"" and the system runs solid. I sure hope new GPU prices start coming down soon.

Amd,"Swapping from i7-8700k to R9 5900X in 3-4 months, need advice on new platform components","Hi there dear AMD community!

Having been an Intel user for over 20 years, I've finally decided to give AMD a try because so far I'm incredibly impressed by their performance with the 5XXX series. It shits on Intel pretty much everywhere as far as 1440p gaming and productivity goes.

I'm currently rocking an i7-8700k with 1080 Ti in my system and would like to switch to a 5900X this year with a 3080 somewhere near year when/if the price pathology ends. 

Since I'm clueless as far as AMD goes, I would like to ask you friends for some advice - I'm going to have to switch my entire platform, therefore I'd really appreciate it if you guys could hook me up with some components.

I plan to go with the R9 5900x - I'm mostly doing gaming at 1440p144hz, but I also do some intermediate video editing in Sony Vegas and After Effects therefore the 4 extra cores and higher cache of the 5900X are a nice bonus compared to the 5800X, so please don't try to persuade me to go 5800X.

Since I've used only Intel up to this point, I also need a decent mobo, I plan to overclock the CPU, but nothing extraordinairy, not pushing any limits. From what I've heard 4.5 - 4.6 GHz should be easily achievable, therefore I would love to have you guys suggest me a good mobo for it, some criteria below:

- I'm a sucker for looks, so some lighting would be nice. 
- Needs some decent VRM so I could go for a 4.5 - 4.6 GHz overclock on all cores, or something along these lines. 
- I only have a single NVMe M.2 SSD, and one SATA SSD.

From what I've heard RAM plays a very important role in overclocking the Ryzen CPUs. My RAM at the moment is what I would define as subpar: GoodRam IRDM X, DDR4, 2x8 GB, 3000MHz, CL16 overclocked to 3666 MHz at about CL18-19.

To top if off I'd also need to get to get a better AIO to cool that beast. I currently have Coolermaster MasterLiquid 240mm AIO, but I'm not sure it'll be compatible with the AM4/5900X. I've never used AMD before so I am totally out of the loop on that format.

From what I've heard and seen on benchmarks the Arctic Liquid Freezer II 240, being relatively new, seems to be somewhat of a beast in terms of cooling. It's cheap, not really flashy, but it doesn't need to have any fancy screens on the pump or RGB, I can ""flash it out"" myself by just replacing the fans for some Corsair LL ones if need be. 

My PUS is EVGA SuperNOVA G+ 750W 80+ Gold. I'm thinking it'll be enough. I'm currently using it to power i7-8700k oc'd to 5.1 ghz with 1080 Ti running at max 120% powerdraw. 

So what I need:

- new Mobo: will want to overclock all cores to 4.5/4.6 ghz, RGB appreciated but not needed
- new RAM, at least 16 GB dual channel upgraded to 32 gb quad channel in the future (RGB goodness appreciated, should be capable of running the 5900X overclocked to 4.5/4.6 all cores)
- new AIO (possibly Arctic Liquid Freezer II 240)

Amd,New UEFI BIOS updates for ASUS AMD motherboards W24 - 6 Motherboards - X570 - New AGESA build - 1.2.0.3 Patch A - Formal release of 1.2.0.2 -,"  

https://preview.redd.it/k3xbli14y2671.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7034960517fb85e7b2cc2dafb3273a8837335361

**New UEFI BIOS updates For ASUS AMD  motherboards – W24**

\*Please do not ask about motherboards not listed. Please review the FAQ below for details.  
   
 

**AMD – X570**

These releases are a continuation of the recent post-announcement communicating 400/500 series boards will be receiving this [1.2.0.3](https://1.2.0.3) Patch A release as we move into Q3. All boards are expected to be updated by end of July possibly early August.  
   
 

**UEFI BIOS update list noted below – A total of 6 boards with a UEFI BIOS update.**

**W24 is in relation to the workweek, these updates were released between the June 11th-16th**

***Why is my motherboard not listed?***

It may have been recently updated. Check https://www.asus.com/us/support/ to see if it has been. I post updates on a weekly basis. UEFI’s are released in waves, because of this it can take an entire series weeks or months to see the “same” update if it includes items like CPU firmware. Furthermore, keep in mind that not all updates are applicable to all models. Due to inherent design differences as well as specification and feature variation an update may only be applicable to a specific model.

***How can I be notified about UEFI updates when they are released?***

If you want to be kept in the loop, you can also follow me for notifications when updates are released/posted. I am also the admin for our PCDIY Facebook Group where I post updates and other ASUS centric product news [https://www.facebook.com/groups/ASUSPCDIY](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ASUSPCDIY) 

***How long after a board is produced will UEFI updates be released?***

Keep in mind that generally after a year a motherboard reaches a certain maturity level and as such will see fewer updates. If you feel you have an issue that is dependent on a UEFI release, please submit a support ticket. In some cases, some boards can see updates for more than 24 months+

***I want to update but am not sure how to update the UEFI ""BIOS""?***

If you want guidance on how to flash/update your UEFI BIOS please watch the video linked below.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scK8AP8ZACc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scK8AP8ZACc) 

***Should I update the UEFI if my system is stable and running without issue?***

If your system is running without issue, especially if overclocked in any way ( including DRAM ) it is advised you stay on the build/release you are on. Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can change the OC experience and require you to retune a previously stable OC value. This does not mean the UEFI is not a functioning release but that changes in the underlying code base need to be accounted for when tuning a system. As many of these values are in low level or specific operating parameters it is best to retune from full UEFI defaults after you have re-run stability test at UEFI defaults.

***What if the UEFI BIOS listed is a BETA? Should I update?***

BETA UEFI releases are for enthusiasts who want access to the latest features, functions, and microcode enhancements, and overall UEFI improvements. As they are not officially supported, they are not recommended for day-to-day / long-term use. Users who plan to use their system in this capacity and want to ensure the best interoperability/compatibility and stability, as well as performance, should wait for a formal release.  
 

***How long does it take for a formal release to be issued (between BETA and formal)?***  
 

The time span between a BETA and formal release can vary depending on multiple factors including new internal code being provided, validation and qualification as well as other important aspects of UEFI development and validation. Generally, you will see a formal release within 1 to 3 months. In some cases, BETAs are singular releases and will not see a formal release.

***Will a UEFI ""BIOS"" update improve the performance of my system?***

A UEFI update can include CPU microcode as well as other performance tuning enhancements that can influence/increase performance. With this noted it is generally minimal. As always performance analysis/comparisons should be done at stock-to-stock values. This means loading F5 on both releases and comparing your application/benchmark scores. OC-related comparisons may require retuning prior to testing as changes to underlying auto rules can invalidate prior scores even if with similar settings.

***Not every user should update/flash their UEFI BIOS. I stress this again, if you are running without issue(s) you are advised to stay on the release you are running.*** 

***Notes to consider -***

***\* When flashing please perform the update process at full UEFI defaults. Do NOT flash with an overclocked system/profile.***

1.I recommend updating the UEFI BIOS on your motherboard for new PC builds. This helps to ensure the best interoperability, compatibility, and performance. If you are building a PC and have not yet installed the OS, I would recommend you update the UEFI.

2.Keep in mind flashing/updating the UEFI will reset all defined parameters/settings and operating profiles. You will not be able to restore defined values by using a UEFI Profile as profiles are not interoperable between builds. It is advised you note or screenshot (F12) your values prior to flashing if they are complex. Upon completing a flash, I would recommend you load UEFI defaults after the fact and complete a full reboot and shutdown prior to re-entering your prior values. Keep in mind you may need to retune these values under a new UEFI.

3.When you update the UEFI and re-load UEFI defaults depending on your originally defined CSM/UEFI device parameters you may experience BOOT issues. Depending on prior settings you may need to enable or disable CSM to restore BOOT functionality.

4.Be advised that in some cases a rollback to a prior UEFI is not possible. This generally is the case when there is an update that includes CPU microcode (such as an AMD AEGSA or Intel ME). This means you may not be able to “flashback” to a prior release.

5.While not always necessary some UEFI updates may require a clearing of the CMOS. You can either clear the CMOS via the CLR CMOS button if your motherboard has this feature/function or you can also CLR CMOS by removing the onboard CMOS battery for at least a few minutes. You can also attempt to locate the CLR CMOS jumper on the motherboard and short the pins.

6.In some cases, you may not be able to jump from an older UEFI release to a much newer release. You may need to ""step"" update, this will mean upgrading incrementally to a slightly newer build first prior to going to the most recent build/release. In most situations this not required.

I also recommend you backup your system prior to any flash/update and always advise flash/update become executed from a fresh loading (F5) of UEFI defaults.

The board model/name is on the right-hand side and the version number is on the left-hand side. To download the UEFI BIOS please go to https://www.asus.com/support/

* X470 Auros Gaming 7 wifi (bios can be flashed for 5000 series)

So games like Cyberpunk run like trash unless I do a lot of tweaking. Even then my averages are around 35fps to 50fps. I'm wondering if the upgrade to a 5800x will be worth it. My main game is Path of Exile which is more GPU bound if I recall correctly.

Micro Center has the 5800x for a decent price of $380. If the results are a lot less stuttering and a bit more fps that would be nice. I don't expect my mind to be blown at all with this upgrade. Thoughts?",False,35,0,3,0

Amd,"AMD: Radeon Image Sharpening (RIS) has been a big hit, and I think I speak for many gamers when I say we'd like to see more features like RIS in the future!","I have the privilege of being an old gamer, and I say privilege because I've been lucky enough to see a lot of technological advancements that others were just born into.  Over the years that I've been using AMD a lot of features have been added to our cards.  

Some features have been extremely convenient, like Chill and Frame Rate Target Control (FRTC), both of which were small, but *important,* problem solvers.  

Some features I just have to take your word for it that they're working, I can't *see* Anti-Lag or Enhanced Sync working, they're practically under the hood from my perspective, but I enable them because why not?  
  
And some features I simply can't live without today, features like FreeSync Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) and Radeon Image Sharpening (RIS) are now a foregone requirement for any monitor or GPU purchase I make.  The improvement to image quality is dramatic, I can't go back.  
  
Radeon Image Sharpening is, I believe, a post-processing filter, it's a layer added on top of a fully rendered frame.  Post-processing effects are nothing new, gamers have been using SweetFx and ReShade for more than a decade now, even AMD touched its toe into the water some time ago when they released their Morphological Anti-Aliasing (MLAA) filter.  What I'm getting at is that this is known and familiar technology, devs know how it works, hell, *you guys* know how it works because *you guys* added RIS and MLAA to your drivers!  
  
With that in mind, there are a *ton* of post-processing filters that I think would be useful on your cards.  These are off the top of my head, and more informed users can provide a better list, this should just be considered a starting point.  (In no particular order.)  
  
Semi-objective image quality improvements:  
  
 * Anti-aliasing: (SMAA, TAA, FXAA, MLAA, NFAA, etc) can be used by just about anybody playing a game with sub-par built in AA, and there are a lot of them.    
 * Film grain: Film grain can help address color banding and hide graphical imperfections.  
 * Ambient occlusion: (MXAO) can be used to inject very, very *rough* ambient occlusion into a game that may not have it.  
 * Fake HDR: Deepen the black levels in a game to give it an ""HDR-look"" without having to have an HDR monitor.  
 * Color adjustments: Vibrancy, brightness, contrast, hue, color balance, saturation, and anything else you can think of to let a player dial in their perfect picture.  
 * Color adjustments 2: Could you guys do a driver level color-blind filter?  Because holy hell could a lot of people benefit from that!  
 * ~~Image Sharpening: You already did this one, and I love it!~~  
  
Subjective image quality improvements:  
  
 * Vignette filters: Darken the corners of the screen to bring the player deeper into the center of the picture.  
 * Chromatic aberration: A prismatic lens flare effect, can add a lot of atmosphere to a picture.    
 * Motion blur: Okay, so, 99.9% of us turn off motion blur just by default, but it could still be a potentially useful filter to have on hand for LFR gamers.  (NiOH 1 had a *very subtle* motion blur filter, maybe you could use that?)  
  
Screenshot filters:  
  
 * Bloom: Can give light sources the illusion of casting actual light.    
 * Lens Flare: Don't look at the sun!    
 * Depth of Field: Set the focal distance of the camera/image to better draw a viewer's attention.  
 * (As a side note, there are many fully *playable* bloom, flare, and DoF filters available, I usually leave bloom enabled when I'm gaming, but by and large these are novelty filters.)  
  
Utility filters:  
  
 * Distortion Correction and Perfect Perspective: Useful for people with curved monitors to get a closer to natural image.  (I think.  I don't have a curved monitor.)  
  
Look, I'm just telling you stuff you already know.  There are dozens of unique post-processing filters available today, many of them can provide fairly *objective* image improvements, like Sharpening and Anti-aliasing; many provide subjective improvements, like Chromatic Aberration and Vignette; many provide useful tools for screenshot artists, like DoF and Bloom; and some of them correct problems, like skewed perspectives.  There's a little bit of something for everyone in the filter bucket, I imagine that even hardcore gamers could benefit from having an additional way to limit their frame rate (Yet another filter in ReShade), and casual gamers like myself would probably love to smooth out our graphics with a touch of film grain, everyone gets *something.*  
  
Radeon Image Sharpening is a *default on* feature for me, I don't turn it off anymore, I don't use sharpening filters in ReShade anymore either, and I know I'm not alone in this.  Customers from all across your product line benefitted when you released RIS, many of us can't do without it anymore, and I think adding more filters similar to RIS would be a (comparatively) easy win, one that the vast majority of us would use.  
  
I'm not calling for full scale integration and implementation of SweetFx/ReShade (Though that would be cool!), if AMD wanted to you could just pick a handful of existing filters and stability test the hell out of them, or make your own proprietary filters specifically designed for your cards and drivers, it's not the under the hood stuff that I'm worried about, it's what's on the screen.  
  
With the above in mind, I'd like to add on one more, supplemental, request: Modernize Adrenaline's legacy filter effects, you know the ones: AA Use/Enhance/Override, AA Method MSAA/AMSAA/SSAA, MLAA Enable/Disable, AF Disabled/Enabled, etc.  Pretty much the whole bottom two thirds of the graphics options menu.  (There are a lot more features I'd like to see added to Adrenaline, too, double V-Sync, LOD adjustments, set flip queue size, stuff like that, but that's a whole other post.)  
  
Most of us use RIS every time we game, there's an opportunity there, an opportunity that I hope you'll take.",False,218,0,132,0

Amd,FSR and VSR tag team..?,"This may in fact be a stupid question, but here goes...

I suspect FSR will truly only look its best and be effective at 4k. I personally game at 1440p for two reasons...

1) my TV can only go to 60hz at 4k, and my freesync range is  a paltry 48-60hz at 4k

2) I set my desktop to 1440p because I get 120hz, and the full freesync gamut of 40-120hz on my TV at that resolution. It's just a better experience.


I think the loss in fidelity will be much more noticeable when applying FSR to visuals rendered natively at 1440p.

So a light bulb went off in my head, and my question is this... would it be possible to use VSR in conjunction with FSR? I would set my VSR at 4k 120hz while also applying FSR to the rendering on virtual display.

The idea is that I get the benefit of FSR performance uplift without as much loss in visual fidelity. In my brain it feels like this would give me a baked in AA solution, and my 6800 should still be able to provide high stable fps thanks to the bump provided by FSR on VSR.",False,18,0,1,0

I  purchased a 6800XT Midnight Black and have been having constant crashes.  I've reinstalled my OS, reverted drivers, updated my BIOS, done  everything I can think of from a software standpoint to get it to work.  Every time I get an error report when a game crashes, it is always  something to do with graphics issues (DirectX errors, PhysX errors,  shader errors, etc). The only new part in my system is the GPU. And,  yes, I am using two separate PCIe cables for my card.

So,  I put in a warranty request to RMA my card. The kicker? My PSU is a  650W. So, the person dealing with my request asked me to go purchase a  brand new 750W power supply, even though I have experienced zero system  restarts or BSOD screens. I have also had no events in the event viewer  signifying a power issue.

I bought the PSU. It didn't fix the issue. So now not only do I have a computer that doesn't work, I am also down $120.

Amd,AMD Direct Buying Guide: How to actually get a GPU or CPU,"**Introduction**

This will be a guide on how you can actually buy a card or CPU from AMD Direct. Note, this guide is for NA. For context, I have been able to get four things from AMD Direct. 1) 6800 that I bought back in Feb. 2) Ryzen 9 5900X that I bought for a friend last month. 3) 6800 XT Midnight Black last week. 4) 6700 XT that I also bought for a friend just today.

It is suprisingly not that difficult to get a card from AMD Direct once you learn these steps, and while having some patience.

**Choosing a card/CPU**

It feels lke I'm writing a guide for a game, but some cards are rarer than others. In order from least to most rare:

GPUs:

    6700 XT -&gt; 6800 -&gt; 6900 XT -&gt; 6800 XT -&gt; 6800 XT Midnight

For CPU's, the 5900X seems to be easier to get than the 5950X. The 5600X and 5800X CPU's are readily available now.

Keep this in mind for when you decide what card/CPU you want to get. *If I personally didn't have a card, I'd try to go for the 6800 Non-XT or 6700 XT.*

**Step 1: Getting ready**

There are really four main things you need to have/know before you buy something:

* What time/day AMD drops
* The ""Add To Cart"" script
* The StockDrops Discord server (optional?)
* Refresh Bans

AMD usually drops on Thursdays at 11:30 AM EST or 8:30 AM PST. So, you're going to want to get on a little before those times.

The Add To Cart (ATC) button appears differently by region, but thankfully, there is a script that makes it appear regardless of your region.

The script is incredibly simple, no need to install any programs. To use it, you simply create a bookmark of your choice, and for the URL, you want to copy and paste this:

    javascript:(async () =&gt; { s=document.createElement('script'); s.innerHTML=(await (await fetch(`https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sebast1an99/ca41e69a0fcb3f6c1cceb0bc05668e6e/raw/amd.js?v=${new Date().getTime()}`)).text()); document.body.appendChild(s); })()

You're going to want to keep this bookmark in your bookmarks bar, [as so](https://i.imgur.com/JlKDu6n.png). You can actually test the script right now without there being a drop, simply go to any product page on AMD Direct, and when you're on the page hit the bookmark on your bookmarks bar. You'll see the button change from OOS to ATC and it'll attempt to add to cart.

Another thing to know about is about Refresh Bans. Basically, if you refresh the AMD Direct pages too many times, you will get banned from buying anything for 24 hours. There will be cases (in later steps) where you *will* have to refresh, and so you want to keep your refreshes minimal. More on this later. If you get banned however, you can clear your browser's cookies and you should be unbanned, but this means you have to restart if you have something in your cart (this will make more sense later).

Once you have the script and know the other info, you're pretty much good to go. But I have to give a shout out to the StockDrops discord server for being the only reason I know of any of this. I recommend you join the server, and near the time there is a drop, in the #general-na channel, others will also be there trying to get a card. It's useful as some people can provide info during the drop, like if a drop is still happening or if Captchas are starting to appear (more on Captchas later). The link if you join is discord.gg/stockdrops

**Step 2: The drop happens**

Pretend now that it's Thursday at 11:30 AM EST. It's time to get a card. See if others in the StockDrops Discord server have seen cards/CPUs being dropped. In order to see if they're actually dropping on your own, or if others on the Discord are indicating that a drop is happening, you're going to want to hit the ATC Script from earlier on the page of the card/CPU you want, and you'll see it try to add the card/CPU for you. If you see a Captcha pop up, there is 100% a drop occuring. If not, then you just need to keep trying. Sometimes the Captcha doesn't pop up right away.

Once the Captcha does appear, most of the time, the Captcha will just time out. You're going to want to keep trying the Captcha and the second ATC button (you will see a second ATC button appear once you completed the Captcha).

Be patient. The card/CPU will more than likely not appear in your cart at first. You're gonna want to keep trying.

If the Captcha page dissapears **and** you notice that the first Add to Cart button no longer works (sometimes the Captcha dissapears but the first ATC button still works, in that case just hit the button again), you're going to want to hit the refresh button. The script will start working again.

Eventually, you will see [this page](https://i.imgur.com/NDBTYcV.png) pop up, this means its in your cart. Now, it's time to checkout.

**Step 3: Checking out**

*I just got a 503 error!*

You will, 100%, get a 503 error. Do not worry, this doesn't mean the card/CPU is gone. You're simply going to hit refresh if you get a 503. Don't spam it, you're gonna see the loading icon spin in the top on your tab. If you refresh and see the icon is not spinning anymore, hit refresh again. If you see the icon spinning for a very long time, you will probably get to the payment info screen.

Just know that any time you get a 503, regardless of what page you're on, just refresh. Don't spam it, only hit refresh again if you see the loading icon isn't spinning anymore.

Once you get to the Payment Info screen, I recommend you *don't* use PayPal. That itself can freeze, so I recommend you just plug in your payment details manually. I recommend setting up Chrome's auto credit card feature for this. It'll be the fastest way to input your info.

Once you're done with that, you're gonna want to go to the Shipping Page by hitting the Next button at the bottom. This itself may not load right away (you'll see a spinning circle). If you see the circle dissapear and it hasn't loaded, just hit the Next button again.

Once you're on the Shipping Info page, by default, the page will ship to your payment info's address, and will ship with 5-7 Days shipping with Fedex. If this is fine for you, you don't have to do anything on this page, and so as soon as you get the Shipping Page, just hit next to go to the Complete Order page. Like before, the circle may dissapear when you hit Next. Just keep trying slowly.

Throughout all this, you will probably get more 503's. Just remember what I said before.

You will then get to the Complete Order page. Once here, you want to accept the Terms and Conditions check box and hit Place Order. This, once again, may not work right away. You may get a 503, or the button will just not work. Don't spam the Place Order button, but do click it in small intervals.

If you've made it past this point, and the Place Order button works, you will be redirected to a Order Confirmation screen. This means you probably got a card/CPU. There are cases though, which the order can get cancelled, and that's really not something you can control unfortunately. So as long as you got to this page, you're mostly good to go, and secured a card/CPU.

**Closing**

That's basically how you get a card. It just requires a little patience and following the steps religiously to get a card. If anyone is confused by anything I've said or needs some sort of visual examples, I'm 100% willing to provide those.

Otherwise, I hope this guide leads to at least one actual gamer getting a card. Good luck to all :)",False,198,0,81,2

I want to build a pc for recording gameplay and somehow creating Funny Moments videos. For this purpose I've looked at the benchmarks and found ryzen 5 4650g for about 250$ so I'm planning to buy Ryzen 5 4650g.

I don't have any information and I couldn't find any benchmark. I read before that this cpu with its Apu can handle light video editing but I'm kina confused. So my question is can Ryzen 4650g handle this? will it work properly? or I shouldn't buy it.

Currently im gaming on a geforce now service because my 980ti died. I refuse to get a new gpu with current prices, but cpus are way more valuable to me.

Birthday is coming up in the next 2 months and i have been itching for an upgrade.

Amd,5800x Temps Assistance,"Hi All, have had a 5800x since day 1. Believe I've got a lower end of the chips, due to the scores I'm getting within Cinebench R20 - 5600 (stock) 5900 (modifying PBT values). Specs listed below.

Spec:
5800x
Actic Liquid Freezer II
32gb 3600mhz Ballistix using XMP
X570 Gigabyte Aorus Elite
be quiet! SILENT BASE 801 (with the front cover taken off to increase airflow
3070

Idle temps - 42c
Ambient temps - 22c

Everytime the PC is booted it reaches 90c. During a game, the same story, which I've kind of dealt with, but due to it getting into summer, and using the PC for work, my room is becoming more and more unbearable.

Went out and purchased an Arctic Liquid Freezer 2, thinking this was my issue, as I previously had a Dark Rock Pro 4. Nope, still hitting 90 out of the gate. Yes, I've remounted, and checked my thermal paste spread, so much so I've gone through a whole tube of MX4.

Stock, it is getting around 5600 within R20, as it hits 90c straight away at 100% load.

This last week since receiving the new cooler, I've tried changing some settings within Ryzen Master, and within the BIOS (not exclusively mutual). Changing PPT/TDC/EDC values, which does bring my temps down to 85ish, but still it's a little unbearable. Changing the values, does also result in a better R20 score, as I actually reached 5900 following this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/kfpele/5800x_adjusting_ppttdcedc_limits_on_pbo_got_me/) but it's not hugely stable. Also attempted to offset voltage up to -.1 (increasing with testing) which has resulted in a max boost clock of 3999, but still reaching 83c

I know I'm going to get comments like ""It's a hot chip, AMD say it's meant to run at 90"". But at the moment, I'm only asking for assistance and advice from the community to see if anyone else has tried something that has seen results, that's possibly in the same boat as I.

I'm not a total noob at computers, but I am when it comes to overclocking/underclocking, that's fairly new to me.

1) Is it true? Nvidia might ignore the FSR completely because they've got DLSS for RTX cards, and DLSS is one of the major incentives for GTX users to upgrade to an RTX.

Amd,"Reduce your Ryzen 3000, Ryzen 5000 CPU temps by -20°C with this 1 trick.","Are you a Zen 2 or Zen 3 CPU user worried about your CPU temps spike? Do you see your CPU temps spiking to 60 °C or maybe 70 °C when just opening a folder?

Then this trick will help with that. *But caution, this isn't for everyone and you may prefer to not make the changes should you desire. AMD's default recommendations are perfectly fine.*

If you're using a Ryzen 3000 Series or a Ryzen 5000 Series CPU and want to reduce your idle temps spiking up like crazy, all you need to do to stop this is to head to the below address in your computer to make the changes.

**Address:** Control Panel\\All Control Panel Items\\Power Options\\Edit Plan Settings

Basically, head to the control panel power option and edit the power settings. Preferably the Ryzen power plans. Be it Ryzen Balanced or Ryzen High Performance. Which ever you choose to select, head inside and edit the settings. The Sleep / Hibernate / USB suspending options aside, look at the image below.

Preferably, keep the minimum processor state at 99% AND ALSO the 'Maximum Processor State' at 99%. Then click Apply. Then if you check in hwinfo64 or hardware monitor or AMD Ryzen Master (whichever you choose to use everyday), you will notice that the temp spikes are gone.

**What this will do** is stop your CPU from clocking above the base clock in order to stop the temp spike by drawing in very high idle voltages. 

Now, is this same as underclocking? Not really. It's just a simple 1 trick method to not allow your CPU to boost above base. And apparently, boosting above base in those millisecond intervals spike the temps a lot. That's what is prevented here.

A few things to advise however. Even though your daily desktop workloads such as media and browsing will be unaffected, in your games you will see a drop in performance depending upon the speed of your graphics card. This is because your CPU will be hard limited to Base Clocks. In my case, the R7 3700x will be limited till 3600 Mhz or 3.6 Ghz. Even though gaming experience will still be fluid for those locked frame rate users, you won't get the maximum out of the CPU.

If that is fine with you, then this trick should help. I reckon it's going to be a very helpful trick for the stock cooler gang! GG! GL! Peace!

Hi guys,

Our team is currently procuring a new numerical modelling PC to replace our old one. We have budget for an sTRX4 3990X (very excite) which will be a game changer coming from our six-year old Haswell machine.

However, I’m having trouble finding some information that might present a fatal flaw to the build. I can’t find any information on whether we can use an Intel-based system to Remote Desktop to this new AMD-based system. Right now we use an Intel-based laptop to connect to the existing Intel-based modelling PC; does anyone know if there will be any issues remoting from an Intel laptop to an AMD PC via Remote Desktop? I’ve seen sources claiming this won’t work but they might have just been referring to VM migration rather than VM operation. Any advice here would be appreciated.

We’re also unsure what the best host is. VMware appears popular but looks to be a paid product. Are good free options available or is VMware worth the cash?

Finally, from what I've read it appears a discrete GPU per VM provides the best performance outside of the high-end stuff like NVIDIA Quadro 6000 or higher (sadly our modelling software is only NVIDIA compatible...). Is a discrete GPU per VM the best method from your experience?

This is a 2c2t affair with 2 GPU cores, so pretty much lowest end ryzen out there.

Now the interesting bit comes down to what die this particular cpu is suppost to be based off. All sources on the internet tells me that this is Dali based, so the small APU die, manufactured on 14nm process.

But looking at both CPU-Z and HWINFO64 report, that cpu is reported as 12nm and based on picasso core. Looking at the Bios AGESA code, reported by cpuz, it also points to a picasso core. The version shows as ""PicassoPi-FP5 1.0.0.C"" so another indication, that this might be a harvested picasso die, not Dali.

Other specs like frequency, caches seems to be identical to the actual Dali version.

Amd,Ryzen appears to benefit from less input lag the lower the memory speed (1:1:1 already),"This is the ultimate redpill, but I have strong reason to believe that latency of the mouse increases as we upclock the memclock and fabric at 1:1 ratio. It's strange, but at least on an asus or asrock motherboard, setting the lowest possible cas latency and primary timing set, then running the ram at the lowest possible frequency, seems to consistently produce the lowest input lag compared to high frequencies and even XMP. Even though FPS goes down and the benchmarks go down too. 

This is completely despite XMP, and even when XMP is on, the feel of the mouse cannot match. I've tested mostly with single and dual channel, but I will confirm at a later date if dual channel causes more input lag also. 

Before you throw me under the bin, I don't have equipment to test, just 10 years of shooters and 7 years of csgo. I've got a decent memory and a good feel of the mouse, and hit DMG back when things were rosy and crisp and snappy; when I used a gtx 660ti, a intel 3570k, on a z77x-ud5h and 16gb of single channel ram (because my CPU pin contact was a bit crap, so it always bsodded when I ran dual lol).

Previous setup and current setup are as follows: AB350 Pro 4, then into the B550-A from Asus. I suspected that ASROCK had some hot trash memory auto timings, but that seems to not be the case if you manually set the primary timings. R9 280x, 5600x, 2x8=16gb Patriot 4400mhz clocked at 10-10-10-10-20 primaries, 1t, power and gear down disable, and in single channel. Secondaries are all left on auto. 

If someone can confirm my findings, this would make my day, because playing any first person shooter feels like an absolute chore, and as if there was a layer of soap between my G502 and the 170hz CRT running off an onboard dac. Maybe there is some credence to the accusation of higher input lag on ryzen? I've been using it for the last 4 years, and since the start it just felt... off.

Please let me know your thoughts on CTR 2.1 vs PBO2.

I am currently using PBO2 with it's negative curve offsets to undervolt my CPU but I'm wondering if CTR 2.1 would be better.

It's hard to find any definite comparisons. I've only seen one Youtube video which showed CTR 2.1 using less watts and a slightly higher framerate but it didn't show what values were being used in the offset with PBO2 etc.

I recently bought this PC from BestBuy: [https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/cyberpowerpc-gamer-supreme-gaming-pc-white-amd-ryzen-7-3700x-1tb-ssd-16gb-ram-rtx-3070-english/15062981](https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/cyberpowerpc-gamer-supreme-gaming-pc-white-amd-ryzen-7-3700x-1tb-ssd-16gb-ram-rtx-3070-english/15062981)

My Motherboard is MSI B450M/ac R2.0. It currently has Crucial Ballistix DDR4-3000 MHz RAM installed. I have recently read that Ryzen 3000 series benefit from higher RAM speeds, and am considering purchasing Crucial Ballistix DDR4-3600. Moreover, in reviewing my userbenchmark results, my RAM is always the lowest performing component. I am uncertain if that is limiting my overall performance.

I am currently playing Hell Let Loose (which is a poorly optimized game) and will be looking to play BF6 when it comes out. As such, is upgrading to 3600 MHz worth it? Should I purchase the Crucial Ballistix, or is there a better RAM to go with?

Lastly, I play at 1440p. Not sure if that is relevant.

Amd,Which 64GB Ram Kit to Pair with 5950X?," Hey guys,

I  have a 5950X paired with a Dark Hero board, and I'm going to switch out  the ram that I currently have. I bought two of these kits, which I  should've realized would run in quad channel.

[https://www.newegg.com/g-skill-32gb-288-pin-ddr4-sdram/p/N82E16820232905?Item=N82E16820232905&amp;nm\_mc=TEMC-RMA-Approvel&amp;cm\_mmc=TEMC-RMA-Approvel-\_-Content-\_-text-\_-](https://www.newegg.com/g-skill-32gb-288-pin-ddr4-sdram/p/N82E16820232905?Item=N82E16820232905&amp;nm_mc=TEMC-RMA-Approvel&amp;cm_mmc=TEMC-RMA-Approvel-_-Content-_-text-_-)

I've  been able to get it semi-stable at the listed DOCP setting  (3600/16-16-16-36), but occasionally the comp will fail on restart, and  I'll have to mess with ram voltage to get up and  running. Right now I'm  pushing it at 1.47v.

I need some  help clarifying what really is the best ram setup for our chips and my  board. I know that GN posted that video explained running a dual rank  setup with 4 sticks is optimal for Zen3. However my board is definitely  has a daisy chain setup, so wouldn't 2 sticks be the correct way to go?

Also  I do need to stay with 64GB since this is a creative workstation with  very little gaming. What do you guys recommend is the fastest 64GB kit  to pair with?

Amd,PSA: If you are using a 300-series AM4 motherboard with an old BIOS you may need to update the BIOS in order to install/update to Windows 10 2004/20H2/21H2.,"I don't know if there has been a post about this on the subreddit before however now that support for version 1909 has ended I feel it's important to bring this information to the attention of anyone using a 300-series AM4 motherboard as they might not have noticed that their Windows 10 installation has failed to update to one of the later major versions and is therefore no longer receiving updates at all including security updates.

I've first learned of this issue a month ago when I was asked to help with a PC with a 300-series AM4 motherboard that refused to update.

#Symptoms:

Attempting to upgrade to version 2004 or later from Windows 10 1909 or earlier results in error 0xC1900101 (though I've also seen other errors in the update history). You also won't be able to install Windows 10 2004/20H2/21H1 as booting using the installation media will freeze at the Windows logo and the PC will restart.

#Affected hardware:

Looking at posts about this issue it seems that all affected machines have one thing in common: AM4 300-series motherboards with an old BIOS. It's impossible to say if this affects all 300-series AM4 motherboards but it doesn't seem to be limited to one chipset or one manufacturer. It also doesn't seem to impact 400 or 500-series motherboards.

#Solution:

Update the BIOS. I don't know which BIOS version fixes this issue however after I updated the BIOS to the latest version on the machine I had access to, the issue disappeared and Windows 10 updated to version 20H2 via Windows Update.

Source of the solution (includes links to other threads about this issue): https://www.tenforums.com/installation-upgrade/178242-cannot-upgrade-win10-20h2-error-code-0xc1900101-0x20017.html",False,130,0,159,1

Amd,Please don't overhype RDNA 3 based on ridiculous rumors,"Hey!

So those of you who follow tech news like I do probably heard some ridiculous rumors about RDNA 3 being 2.5-3x faster then the 6900XT. We always hear such silly things about upcoming products early on and as we get closer to the release date rumors tend to get more realistic and accurate. If you look at the past few GPU generations, the trends are pretty clear, every generations GPUs get about 30-50% faster, there are outliers sometimes like Pascal was (and RDNA 3 can certainly be one of these) but mostly the trend holds.

So the current rumors about top RDNA 3 is that it'll be a chiplet based GPU with 2 80CU dies. Sounds very exciting and if this will probably be the biggest uplift in performance we'll see between 2 generations in a long while. But it still won't be 2.5-3x faster.

So first off: double the CU double the performance right? Well not really, scaling is never linear. Now you can make up for some of a performance lost with IPC gains of clock speed increases.

There's a problem with that however: On the current node with the current architecture if you were to have 2 80CU dies it would have a TDP of 600W since the 6900XT has a TDP of 300W and has 80CUs. Now AMD promised a 50% perf/watt upgrade over RDNA2 , but even if all that goes towards lowering power consumption (so no significant IPC increase) you're still looking at 450W of TDP if you don't lower clock speeds. I don't think AMD will want to release a 450W card, even 400W is pushing it so they'll probably have to decrease the clock speeds a little to keep power consumption in check which means additional performance loss.

And then there's the problem of latency which a chiplet based design will introduce and usually this has a very detrimental effect on gaming performance. Now technologies like infinity cache and 3D stacked cache can help with this to some extent so it's possible that the performance loss won't be too severe but it would be unrealistic to expect that there would be none at all.

And even if AMD can fix ALL these problems: Create a product that almost scales perfectly with the increase of compute units, outdo themselfs in terms of the perf/watt increase and do way above the promised 50% and keep current clock speeds without TDP getting out of hand, and completely fix the latency issue introduced by chiplets you're still ""only"" looking at double the performance not 2.5-3x. 

And don't get me wrong, if that happens RDNA 3 will be the most AMAZING generation we've seen in like 10+ years when it comes to the performance uplift over the previous generation, it's greater that what Pascal had over Maxwell and will surely beat Nvidias Lovelace (unless they too will go with an MCM design, then we'll see). But people would still be dissapointed because of these stupid rumors.

Now I'm sure there will be way it'll be 2.5-3x faster: The 3090 has 3x the TFLOPs the 2080 Ti has yet it's only \~50% faster in gaming. Ray-Tracing performance still has long ways to go especially for AMD, I'm sure there huge improvements can and will be made with the release of the next generation. RDNA 3 can be improved in ways to gain additional performance improvements over RDNA 2 using FSR. But from what I heard from these ""leakers"" they clarified that they don't mean 3x ray-tracing performance, they mean standard rasterization performance, which just won't happen.

I wrote this post to keep expectations in check, I'd love to be surprised but I don't want people to be dissapointed even if this is the most amazing product we'll se in a long while. Also, if these rumors were true, just imagine the prices... if anything will ever kill PC gaming, normalizing the current GPU prices will surely get the job done but that's a topic for another day...",False,500,0,93,1

Amd,Simply Astonishing!,"I was finally able to get my hands on a 5950x in the last few days and...wow.  I've been through a long chain of AMD chips (and Intel too...) and I wasn't quite sure what sort of an upgrade this would be.  I'd been running a 3900x in my home server and was mostly looking for the extra cores and threads that the 5950x offers.  But I wasn't prepared for the improved all around performance, even in single-threaded applications.  

As compared to Zen 2, the Zen 3 chip is an absolute monster - as a rule, I tend to slightly undervolt my server chips for cooler running and longer life.  And in the same X570 motherboard and with the same 240mm AIO cooler, it runs 100s of MHz faster, with 1/3rd more cores and 1/3rd more threads.  And better instructions per clock cycle to boot.  With a -0.2v voltage adjustment and with PBO on, at least a handful of the cores still hit 5.0ghz in single or lightly threaded applications.  Did I mention it also runs an avg of 5-10c cooler under load?  

As someone that's been building PCs since the K6 days, this might be one of the most surprising generation on generation updates I've seen.

My concern is the motherboard. I have an ASUS ROG Strix x470-f. I've notice people saying it needs a BIOS update to run the newer CPUs. I bought mine in 2018, and when i looked at the BIOS version, it said ""4018 x16"".

Wanted to add a semi-unique battlestation, featuring an open-chassis Alienware Graphics Amplifier.

I have the benefit of being able to use one system for both work and gaming, but therefore need it to be portable when I need to go on-site. The overlap of being a developer and a gamer is that strong internals benefit both my personal and professional life, with the only difference in components being a powerful gaming GPU.

Unfortunately, Alienware didn't offer this model with a high-end Ryzen CPU (or a Threadripper), although they have started offering a Ryzen M15—albeit without the Alienware Graphics Amplifier eGPU dock, which is crucial to my setup, so it was a non-starter.

System specs:

* Alienware Area-51M R2 laptop
* Intel 10900K (10c/20t)
* 64 GB Crucial Ballistix DDR @ 2933 MHz, CL16 (Dell's motherboard can't do 3200 MHz reliably @ 64 GB, only at 32 GB—64 GB must require more electricity then the motherboard can handle reliably)
* 4x 1TB WD Blue SN550 NVMe disks; 1x OS, 2x in Windows Storage Spaces RAID 0 (striped) for improved r\\w performance (Personal/game disks), 1x work
* Intel UHD 630 (iGPU on the 10900K)
* AMD Radeon RX 5700M (dGPU within the laptop)
* Alienware Graphics Amplifier eGPU (PCIe 3.0 4x direct connection to the CPU):
   * XFX Speedster MERC 319 RX 6900 XT
   * Corsair CX650M PSU

This laptop is really a desktop replacement, as it's usually a full-fledged 10900K (@ 125w), and not a laptop CPU. I get the benefit of portability and (essentially) desktop performance at almost no compromise aside from weight. In Time Spy, the CPU scores \~13K, the GPU \~19.5k, for a combined \~19k.

I think this is a pretty unique setup, as few people have (or use) the Alienware Graphics Amplifier, and it's been EOL'd. I spent a lot of time working on them to figure out recent issues with the new GPUs (RX 6000 &amp; RTX 3000 series), which started [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Alienware/comments/jxvnga/project_opencaldera_exploring_adding_unofficial/) and has finally culminated in a bigger post: [The State of the Alienware Graphics Amplifier in 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/Alienware/comments/nk718z/the_state_of_the_alienware_graphics_amplifier_in/)",False,10,0,0,0

Amd,Super Resolution for Dummies?,"I've been hearing about Super Resolution for a while now, and I still haven't really found a ""Super Resolution 101"" guide. I've looked up articles, I've been to the AMD page on it, I've visited forums, and I still have a bunch of questions. Maybe you guys can answer them:

1) Okay, so how exactly does this work? 

From what I understand, the idiot's guide to DLSS would be ""the card uses machine learning to cut corners when it comes to filling in graphics, freeing up space for higher framerates."" From what I've seen of it, it's pretty darn impressive. FSR, to quote AMD, ""uses cutting-edge upscaling technologies to help boost your framerates..."" pretend I'm an idiot (which I am when it comes to this stuff) -- what does that mean? As I understand, no machine learning will be used with FSR. What are the upsides and downsides to that? 

2) What kind of a performance bump should be realistically expected? 

Someday soon the availability gods will smile upon me and I'll become part of the PS5 family. Right now most games on the PS5 can do ""performance"" (checkerboarded 4k, usually with no RT, at 60 fps), or ""quality"" (4k with RT at 30 fps). With FSR, would we be looking at true 4k at 60 fps? 4k/60 with ray tracing? 120 fps options for certain games? 

3) So, does this thing Skynet itself into existing machines and start upscaling everything, or will it only be available for certain titles? 

Will there be a huge balance patch type-deal when FSR goes live and bam, your computer/console has FSR now, enjoy the boosting, or will we have to wait for FSR-supported games that will recognize existing AMD chips and go from there? From what I can tell, it certainly looks like it's the latter, but I'm not sure. Also, how hard will this thing be to implement? Will upcoming titles like Horizon: Forbidden West be able to use it, or will it just be for games that aren't in production yet? 

4) What questions am I forgetting to ask, and how excited should I be about this? 

It's my first post on this Reddit and I really am pretty stupid with this stuff despite trying to do all the research I can, so please don't yell at me too much. Hope y'all are having a good Sunday.",False,47,0,4,0

Getting a graphics card is kind of a clown show at the moment. My overall budget is about two or two and a half grand. If I can get a decent card within a month or so for a price that doesn't cost the down payment of an old honda civic, I'd rather do that.

My plan is to get the rest of the system together and use the integrated graphics of the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X until I can source a GPU for my use case. I figure that I can put up with game settings that leave my eyes unmelted for a month or so. But I haven't seen if Adobe's Creative Suite runs with AMD integrated graphics. They officially support a spate of Intel integrated graphics, but no official confirmation of AMD.

Thank you for your time.

Amd,My first custom PC build,"Got lucky in the NewEgg Shuffle and finally landed a GPU in the Sapphire Pulse 6700 XT (wasn't my top choice, but I'll take it). It was in a combo that came with the ASRock B550M Steel Legend mobo and I'm pretty happy with it.  
I struggled to decide between the Ryzen 7 3700X and the Ryzen 5 5600X and am super happy I opted for the latter - this proc is ridiculous and I threw a Corsair H100i on it to keep it cool.  
I topped it off with 32GB of Crucial Ballistix DDR4-3600 RAM, a few CoolerMaster MF120 fans, a Seasonic Focus GX750 PSU, and a Sabrent 1TB Rocket Plus NVMe 4.0 M.2 SSD all tucked into a Thermaltake S100 Snow Edition case.   
It did take a BIOS update before the XMP Profile would actually work for clocking the RAM at 3600 - before the update it wouldn't even boot with the XMP Profile enabled. But I was still happy I didn't need a previous gen proc in order to boot in the first place - the board was on a new enough version already to support Zen3. AMD Precision Boost Overdrive was easy enough to turn on. I still have a little bit of tweaking to do for the GPU though to see what luck I have with undervolting and overclocking.  
I'm still trying to snag a better GPU, at which point I might switch to a custom loop for cooling, but for now, it'll do everything I need at 1440p. Might throw a storm trooper logo on the front of the case too, seems to be a nice black and white theme.

Amd,6800xt vs 3070 Ti for both Gaming and Productivity?,"Thought I'd start a thread here as I'm curious if any AMD users have real world experience.

I've been on Macbook Pro for almost a decade, decided to switch to PC because I'm due for an upgrade but not willing to early adopt Apple Silicon until all my apps are native.

I recently ordered a 6800xt Midnight Black and EVGA 3070 Ti FTW3 Ultra, neither are in hand yet but shipping soon. I have no other components at the moment and I'm looking to build around one of these cards.

I'll be using the build for gaming and streaming, and I'm also a video editor and edit 4k in Premiere and Resolve frequently.

I got the 6800xt at reference price. I'm paying \~$100cad more for the 70Ti. If I were just purely gaming, I'd have no reservations just going with the 6800xt, but because of my other needs, I'm having a hard time deciding which card to go with. Planning on pairing either one with a 5900x, 32gb ram.

I understand Nvidia is better at encoding and has some optimization with Premiere (cuda), NVENC for streaming etc, but is the difference worth going with a more expensive but ""lower"" performing card?

There's also ray tracing and DLSS which aren't as important to me, but would be nice to have.

I'm rocking tridentZ neo 3600 2x16gb at whatever the DOCP defaults are set to. CPU idles between 40-50c typically, which I've heard is pretty normal for this CPU (Noctua NH-d15 with two fans + noctua paste). sometimes when I'm truly doing nothing, it gets lower, maybe mid to high 30s. 

I guess I'm more or less wondering if there are any low hanging settings I can tweak or disable to have this thing running as cool and quiet as possible when idle. I heard something about Precision Boost Overdrive, for example - although I don't believe this was enabled by default. This CPU seems crazy performant stock so if there are any other settings I can tone down without really impacting much

I suppose I should also mention that my end-goal for this system is to run warzone with as many FPS as I can attain at 2k resolution, in a competitive setting (most effects disabled, i.e., if doing so helps me spot opponents easier). so if it turns out that I don't want to disable stuff, but actually enable other stuff, I'm open to that too.

I have never overclocked an AMD before, and this was my first AMD purchase in 15 years. In general, I am not very experienced with OC. After watching a few videos that explained PBO2 and Curve Optimizer, I started tweaking with settings on my hardware. Following are the settings and results I finally got:

RAM Frequency: 3600 MHz (Set manually without enabling DOCP)

**PBO2 - Advanced**

PPT - 88 W, TDC - 60 A, EDC - 90 A

**Boost Override CPU - 200 MHz**

**Curve Optimizer - Negative 30 All Core**

Multi-Core: Frequency: 4450 MHz, Peak Temp: 85 deg Celsius

Single-Core: Frequency: 4850 MHz, Peak Temp: 56.5 deg Celsius

1. Is this a silicon lottery? or are these results about average for 5600x?
2. Should I upgrade my CPU cooler? I am currently using the stock cooler.
3. All cores are set at -30 Curve Optimization. Should I further tweak cores individually? So far I have not experienced any crashes while testing or gaming.

That's under 450 watts. Even if we factor in 50 watts for the mobo and a couple of M.2 drives, a 500 watt PSU should work (albeit be far from ideal) and a 660 watt be plenty. 

The reason I'm pondering this is because I have an existing Seasonic Prime 660 and a Focus 850 - and I trust the Prime more.

Amd,"ECC on 5800X, Gigabyte B550I","Another post about ECC on Ryzen, plus a few other comments. Linux (Fedora 34) only.

A month ago I did a system upgrade:

- Gigabyte B550I Auros Pro AX
- 5800X
- 2 x Kingston KSM32ED8/16HD dual-rank 2Rx8 ECC unbuffered RAM

This didn't go well; I could not get it to boot (initially the OS installer,
then into the BIOS at all). On talking to the retailer ([kingstonmemoryshop.co.uk])
they recommended returning this RAM and buying KSM32ES8/16ME (16GB single rank 1Rx8)
instead. These work perfectly (and the retailer gave a full refund on the 2Rx8 memory).

I can report that ECC is enabled (according to `dmidecode`) and that the system
has been running stably for the last month. I have not tried overclocking.


### Gigabyte B550I Aorus Pro Ax

This board I ended up keeping but **do not recommend**. I experienced three
issues with it:

1.  The CMOS reset jumpers do not appear to work no matter how I tried (shorting
    with a screwdriver as suggested or using a jumper). The manual does lists a
    second reset method, unplugging the coin cell for one minute. This works but
    is a huge pain to do, thanks to that integrated I/O shield: you must
    uninstall the board, remove several screws from the back, then carefully pry
    off the shield. This basically means I dare not try any overclocking setting
    which could possibly prevent the system from booting (especially since
    builds are more difficult in mini-ITX cases).
2.  The 2.5G network port is terrible. My TPLink ethernet-over-powerline
    adapters started disconnecting from when I first tried using the system.
    Sounds bizarre, but [this thread][2] includes similar reports. This resulted
    in intermittent drops (a few per hour), though recently I haven't been able
    to get it to work at all. It is now disabled in BIOS and I am using a
    cheap USB3 1G adapter (which works but with some errors in `dmesg`).
3.  I cannot get the built-in wifi to work (on Linux). Others reportedly have.
    I haven't put much effort in, but also haven't found much to go on (some
    vague messages in `dmesg` which Google found some similar reports for, but
    only for add-in wifi cards).


### 5800x CPU

It's fast (vaguely 3x over my old Xeon 1231), but you already know that.

Load power usage and temperature can get high (apparently 90C is normal). The
5800x has much higher power/TDP limits than the 5600x — 105W vs 65W — but to
what end? The CPU automatically scales voltage and frequency based on demand and
various limits, but at the high end there does not appear to be much difference:
forcing ""65W TDP"" limits (via BIOS ""eco mode"" under overclocking settings)
results in much lower load temperature (~60C) with very little change in
single-thread or multi-thread performance.

Idle temperatures and fan speeds are higher than I'd expected. Looking more
closely at reviews, it seems that recent AMD desktop CPUs use very roughly 20W
at idle vs 10W for Intel CPUs. (APUs appear much better: they are derived from
the monolithic mobile designs.) According to [this article][1], the memory
controller is largely to blame. Perhaps, then, lower RAM speeds can reduce idle
power usage.

But that's not all: your OS may background jobs from time to time. This Ryzen
CPU scales frequency quickly, thus a single-threaded background job can easily
use most of the CPU's power budget if nothing else is going on. So far I've yet
to find a way of limiting CPU scaling when the only active processes are
low-priority.

While the ""if the minimum requirements of the game are met"" possibly means that FSR might not be relevant right now (that is, on the 22nd), it's still interesting to note that FSR is expected to work well on a weak integrated GPU.

Amd,SMT enabling / disabling.,"Hello. Below is a picture of one of the pages in my BIOS page.

Motherboard is MSI B450 Gaming Pro Carbon.  
CPU is R7 3700X.

My **question** is that, is this option as highlighted in the picture the option to enable / disable SMT of the CPU?

I usually don't play around BIOS since I am not expert but I heard this before that in some old games disabling SMT can give better in game performance. So, I was thinking, maybe running on 8 threads might help me in game.

I was playing Ryse: son of rome and it runs very well on others systems with less threads but very poorly in my system. GPU is Rx 590 but it does not even hit 100% at 1080p max.

But, I'll try to figure out the better performance or not later, could someone please help me with the question above? Thanks in advance.

Amd,Should I upgrade from Ryzen 1600x to 5600x? (Video Editing and Streaming),"I would really appreciate your insight and suggestion. 

I am currently using Ryzen 1600x OC to 3.9Ghz at v1.375 and the temperature is either 38c-46c under load and it is stable.

I want to know if there is a major difference between 1600x and 5600x in terms of speed and render time when exporting a video. I mainly do video editing, streaming and sometimes gaming at 1080p60/1080p240 (not planning for 1440p anytime soon).

1600x seems to be running fine with zero stutters at almost any game I run at ultra settings however it stutters when I record while gaming also it takes a lot of time to export , I am just wondering if 5600x if it takes less time to export a video.

Ryzen 1600x OC 3.9Ghz v1.375

I have PBO enabled and an Optimization Curve of Negative 20 (might try 30). I think the idea is that the CPU will use as much power as it can, whatever you do as long as the thermal headroom is there. If you use the Op Curve to lower volts, you gain some single core Ghz, so the CPU pushes higher until it again reached a set voltage or thermal level.

I'm running a 3900X desktop in a fairly small office. I'm looking at ways to reduce the heat output of my 3900X - when I'm not running heavy workloads; which is most of the time. I've done what I can to make the office vent better with furniture placement and fans, so I'm focusing my attention on the PC.

To be clear: The PC is running cool itself (the Noctua fans are doing their job), but that heat needs to go somewhere and it's making the room super hot. This is not about thermal distribution cooling solutions inside the PC.

I have tried a few things to negligible effect:

* Underclocked the CPU
* Turned off SMT
* Turned off one of the CCDs
* Reduced the power rating for the GPU

Was just starting my guild wars 2 weekend and suddenly pc goes poof and turns off, tried to power back on and it beeps for GPU error.
My now 4 year old rx480 just up and died. At the worst possible time to do so.

Locally, my options for a new part are:

R5 3400g $210

The used market is even worse, gtx 750 are about $200..

Amd,"No, Sapphire doesn't make AMD's reference cards.","There is a common misconception that Sapphire make AMD's reference cards.

This is false.

Scott Herkelman, CVP &amp; GM AMD Radeon, was asked in an episode of PCWorld's Full Nerd if Sapphire makes AMD's reference GPUs and his answer was NO. (Thanks T1beriu for finding this)

So who makes AMD's reference cards?

It's actually PC Partner Group, the company that sell video cards under the ZOTAC brand.

If you look at engineering samples of AMD's cards from the last 10 years or so, you'll see that they have stickers labeling them as products of ""PC Partner Ltd.""

https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d99616060361eed3915dd330b9784fdd430f983902e7a895d2a7430e5dc0382d.jpg

PC Partner is, in fact, the largest contract manufacturer of AMD cards.

https://www.pcgamesn.com/how-nvidia-amd-graphics-card-are-made

There is another misconception that PC Partner owns Sapphire.

This is also false.

As mentioned by Sapphire's own CEO, PC Partner is contracted to make Sapphire cards.

https://www.hexus.net/tech/features/graphics/4393-interview-sapphire-ceo-k-d-au/?page=2

PC Partner manufactures products for a wide range of companies, such as Dell, AMD, Acer, Samsung, Sapphire, LG, Microsoft.

https://www.pcgamesn.com/how-nvidia-amd-graphics-card-are-made

I used these inexpensive 2mm pads. All you have to do is remove the backplate with a few screws, [then cut and put the pads in these spots](https://i.imgur.com/3yLxHJI.png), and put the backplate back on.

I saw a 4-6 Celcius decrease in the VRAM temps. Definitely worth it IMO. I have seen concerns over increased coil whine coming from these cards when doing this mod, but I didn't get any extra coil whine.

I'm unsing a VESA certified DP 1.4 cable and when turning off freesync all looks fine.

(disclaimer) In a world where the [AMD.com](https://AMD.com) prices are, as the mods of r/amd see it, objective, and where the price you actually have to pay is an entirely subjective issue, (/disclaimer)

How much of the AMD GPU's inflation do you think is due to AMD marketing pratices? I'm curious in what you have to say about the organized shortages, the paper realeases, etc - comparing before pandemic and present condition. Did you experience another situation where the price you have to pay is triple the supposed price of the card?  In clear, don't we have a sort of trend here?Could other marketing practices change the price for their long time supporters - the gamers - had to pay to keep their online social life? And I say online social life, but to some it is the whole social thing.

If you are a gamer, did you witness AMD trying to sort you out from the scalpers, apart from the I'm not a robot captcha?

Amd,Radeon Image Sharpening doesn't work anymore on my Vega56,"Hello guys, like the title says I'm struggling with RIS via Radeon Settings.

I was used to have it On on most of my games, with different strength from 10% to 100%, but it's since the 2021 drivers (I suppose, but yes, it's been a while since first time I notice the ""issue"") that it doesn't work anymore on my Vega56.

List of games which **worked** fine with RIS but now it makes no difference:

* The Division 2
* Destiny 2
* Final Fantasy XV

List of games in which RIS doesn't work after I noticed the issue:

* Apex
* Scavengers
* Hood: Outlaws &amp; Legends
* Deep Rock Galactic
* Pumpkin Jack
* Divinity: Original Sin 2
* Hellblade
* Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order

The only game in my current library that works with RIS is Dragon Quest XI.

I remember I was used to use RIS on other games like Nier: Automata and BioShock Remastered, but I don't have them installed at the moment. Might try.

Additional info:

* I have RIS On in both General Settings &gt; Graphics **and** Gaming tab.
* I'm using a 21:9 FreeSync HDR display.

Amd,For people who are looking for XFX 5700 XT triple dissipation gpu blocks.,"I had a hard time initially trying to get a waterblock for my card and I was looking around to see if the usual suspects would have a block such as ekwb but they stopped selling them and ebay listings were not as clear as some just were thicc 2/3 for 300$. Eventually I found out that the 3 cards are all the same and the triple dissipation and thicc 2 are more similar in specs and layout. I got an alphacool block for xfx thicc 2 and it fit perfectly with no issues. Even the backplate fits.  

So if anyone is looking for a block for the XFX 5700 XT Triple Dissipation, the best fit is thicc 2 and from what I have seen all of the companies who made them or are still selling them from third parties are gonna fit even with the backplate. There are also some that give you the option of using the xfx backplate as well.


This is the block I purchased but they keep showing up with more.

I've looked into undervolting the CPU - but all the guides I can find, only focus on performance and not so much noise levels / temps. With PBO2 you can get +5% performance boost with the same temps - but is it possible to maintain the same performance (ish) and get the temperatures down?

Amd,GPU choices in the current market pricing,"Hi all!

I have a question for you all. Considering the current GPU pricing situation, I have noticed that for most NVidia cards and some of the lower-end AMD cards, prices are inflated beyond reason. However, the 6900XT seems to be one that stayed quite close to its MSRP, be it from retailers or in the reseller market.

For example/context, where I am, the 3080 can fetch upwards of EUR1500 with higher-end AIB models coming close to EUR2000. The 3090, despite being a poor value, to begin with, still sells for around EUR2200 with high-end models going upwards of EUR3000. 

So, question is, given similar/identical prices, would you buy a 3090/3080 or a 6900XT? So, say at a price of EUR2000, you can either get these ""Ultimate"" 6900XTs with the Navi 21XTXH die, or you can get some low-to-mid-range RTX3090s, or some high-end RTX3080s. Alternatively, if we consider the price of EUR1500, then you can either get low-to-mid-range 6900XT or mid-range RTX3080.

BSOD  
When I start my PC up and try and access any form of media whether  it's Youtube/twitch/game I get a blue screen Driver power state or something, But if i leave it for about 3 minutes then carry on its fine, almost as if it needs to heat up, this problem i can deal with as i say, if i start up then do something else i can carry on using my PC as normal without any blue screens.  


Audio Cutting out

pretty self explanatory, while playing games such as PUBG and Rocket League, my audio will cut out for as long as a second at various times, If i have a video playing on my second monitor the audio from that continues while the game would cut out.  


Driver Timeouts  
This one I've never seen until the past week, While gaming, Both monitors go black, (Audio continues) they both come back on after a few seconds and the game I'm playing has crashed as well as any video such as YT/Twitch, there's an error screen saying driver timeout and asking me to report it, (I have) I obviously have to restart the game and any video I'm watching in my browser (Chrome, if its relevant)

&amp;#x200B;

I recently plugged a disc drive in which involved Removing the GPU to access SATA ports (It's since been removed), no drops or anything to report, I took it out, I put it back in, I've been able to play games for quite a while and had no issues but then, a timeout out of nowhere, although the audio cutouts have been constantly happening throughout.  
Originally i was on 21.4.1 then I DDU'd in safe mode to 21.2.2, then I tried 21.3.1, now I'm back trying 21.4.1 after re-seating my GPU hoping there was a problem there, although all the connections were properly seated.  


I have had this whole setup for roughly a year and had zero problems,  I read about BIOS updates but surely if my PC has been perfect for a year that shouldn't be needed. I also read about the latest Windows update being a possible problem, as well as the GPU power supply and cables, they're the same ones I've been using for a year (6+2 X 2 connectors).

I did a lot of research to help myself, but didn't really get to the bottom of this. I have a Ryzen 5 3600 with a Scythe Mugen 5 Rev B cooler. It's not even 4 months old. First I used HW Info and it showed idle temps of 45-55 degrees with only Discord and a web browser open. While gaming it reached 70-80 degrees. I wasn't too worried because the case of the computer has one of these magnetic dust filters on top and when I put my hand above it, it's like putting it in a fridge. Now recently my game crashed and HW Info showed 95 degrees top temp. I tested the same scenario with Ryzen Master and played for 2 hours, with Ryzen Master not showing temps higher than 69 degrees.

My question now is: Should I just trust the monitoring app provided by Ryzen and forget about HW Info or should I be concerned? Cinebench stresstest by the way didn't go any higher than 70 degrees.

**Notes:** With these settings, I see regular boosts to 4.85ghz, 4.95ghz during gaming (with a 1.44v boost).

I know Ryzen chips love high voltages and all, but the 5800x seems to be on another level!

I can significantly reduce temps for only about a 3% loss in performance if I set a -50mv all-core vcore offset. But I don't see a reason to sacrifice performance if gaming temps are 50c and the system is stable with the settings above. 

Also, I could not go beyond a negative 10 all-core offset with curve optimizer. As soon as I tried -15, I would get reboots right after the benchmark. I also CAN boost to +200mhz with the negative 10 all-core offset, and there are no issues as far as I can tell, but I am not greedy and would rather play it safe.

Depending on the game of course, if it's a really demanding game than they usually stay on much longer.

My gpu is an Asus ROG Strix LC 6800 XT (aio) and I've replaced the 2 aio fans with 2 Noctua industrial 3000 rpm fans so they're nice and quiet. When I'm not gaming (Zero RPM enabled) the gpu runs at 53C/57 junction (aio pump always stays on, fans off), if I disable Zero RPM altogether it's 25C/30 junction.

I guess my question is, should I just disable Zero RPM altogether and just let the fans run all the time? At first I thought that Zero RPM may prolong the life of the fans by them not running when not needed but with it enabled the fans are usually cycling off and on when gaming quite frequently and imo fans take more abuse when they come off and on rather than just run.

What I've done so far in order to fix it: Scanned PC, Updated Windows, updated all drivers including deleting them via DDU and AMD cleanup Utility, tweaked BIOS and AMD Adrenaline, ran memtest, ran few other memory and GPU tests with no errors, re-seated ram and gpu, physically cleaned pc and parts, rolled back from Adrenaline 2021 to a more stable one from 2019, disabled CStates and Cool'n'Quiet mode, forced VSync on and off, tried removing each ram stick, and many others that I already forgot, nothing seems to have any impact.  


2 years ago I had a simillar problem regarding playing Witcher 3, my pc would also hard freeze, I remember I fixed it by making AMD Adrenaline force Vsync ON and then turning Vsync off in Witcher 3, but now those options wouldn't fix my problem, also problem occurs all the time, not because of a specific game.

Is this normal behaviour? I have the offset set to -0.1V now because it seems to give much lower temperatures while maintaining the same gaming performance, and even better all-core performance. I've had a look at other people's benchmarks and it seems that my CB23 scores (even the highest ones) are quite low. Any trick to get improve this without Curve Optimizer? 

I can't go any higher on TDC and EDC. Another thing I noticed is that with the 3900X, it was drawing 180W when benchmarking, but the 5950X is barely passing 140W total.",False,26,0,1,0

Amd,Modifying PCH Fan Curve on non-Modded ASUS X570 BIOS,"**Warning: These instructions offer a solution to a long standing problem but it involves BIOS modification. Before proceeding, exercise caution and be fully aware of the risk of bricking your motherboard.**

ASUS ROG Strix X570-I motherboard (and others) have had an annoyance: The PCH fan which is audible at 3.5k rpm and becomes a loud high pitch mosquito whine at higher speeds (which can reach higher than 6.5k rpm) (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/d0g5kj/asus_fix_the_rpm_of_the_pch_fan_or_give_us/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) for instance). The fan curve makes it climb to these high rpms even when temperatures are not very high (e.g., \~6.4k rpm @ 75 degrees). Many solutions have been tried, including modding the BIOS to enable editing the fan curve. This worked great until before BIOS version 3406 (AGESA 1.2.0.0) at which ASUS enforced only non-modded flashing for X570-I (X570-E and -F are not blocked yet). See related [post](https://www.hardwareluxx.de/community/threads/asus-x570-strix-series-x570-e-gaming-x570-f-gaming-x570-i-gaming.1236042/post-28134293) by modder *(in German)*.

A recent [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FormD/comments/ktt4wr/dropping_your_strix_x570i_board_chipset_temp/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) offered a way for editing a BIOS setting that helps prevent the chipset from getting too hot in the first place by enabling something called ASPM. This seems to help as some have reported. But did not keep the fan quiet enough for others, like me. But the method itself that was used was a great source of inspiration because it makes your brain pop this question: “Would it be possible to directly edit the PCH fan curve hidden in the bowels of the BIOS?” I embarked on a journey yesterday to answer it.

Like many BIOS fan curve settings that use lower-middle-upper specification points, the default PCH curve is specified by (55°,0%),(60°,40%),(93°,100%). A much quieter curve would need just one value changed (PCH Fan Middle Temperature: 60 -&gt; 80):

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e7yjdf760s371.png?width=420&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d2b3b98360945017a42fbeac1c8d96c82b3f7a7

The following is how I did this change on my X570-I with BIOS version 3603 (that I recently upgraded to). And it worked!! The main caveat that needs attention is that the variable offset at which this setting needs to be written may vary depending on the BIOS version. So it is important to get the correct offset.

## Phase 1: Getting the correct variable offset for your BIOS

## Tools:

1. UEFITool: `UEFITool_NE_A58_win32.zip` from [https://github.com/LongSoft/UEFITool/releases](https://github.com/LongSoft/UEFITool/releases)
2. Universal IFR Extractor: [https://github.com/donovan6000/Universal-IFR-Extractor](https://github.com/donovan6000/Universal-IFR-Extractor)

## Steps:

* 1.  Locate your BIOS CAP file (or download it from ASUS)
* 2.  Load CAP file into UEFITool
* 3.  Ctrl-F to search and type “pch” in the Text tab:

https://preview.redd.it/576spkrf1s371.png?width=208&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df2d793d3d4302d62d8c0ce9033c0af45f11b70d

* 4.  Export the found results to file `Section_PE32_image_Setup.sct`

https://preview.redd.it/r45ao6ab2s371.png?width=703&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a6bf9a3ffeb90e9e597b9c59df898bfef1e0090

* 5.  Load `Section_PE32_image_Setup.sct` into Universal IFR Extractor and click Extract to save the result to a text file:

https://preview.redd.it/g91bs9ag2s371.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=814f76def2c2f0eff7b8d0aa56dc9b688ea7c735

* 6.  Search for “PCH Fan Middle Temperature” in the test file and write down the variable offset (**0x3A** in this example):

https://preview.redd.it/6dgfxvwn2s371.png?width=789&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1693653dffe0ea931e2216cdd9f14da42a52259c

* Note it is a single byte value and it has a value of 0x3C (=60 decimal, the 60 degrees middle temperature value)

## Phase 2: Modifying the PCH curve in the BIOS

## Tools:

1. The efi file (`modGRUBShell.efi`) from release 1.3+ from [https://github.com/datasone/grub-mod-setup\_var/releases](https://github.com/datasone/grub-mod-setup_var/releases)

## Steps:

* 1.  Format a USB drive (small is OK since we only need 3MB), making sure the file system is FAT32.
* 2.  On the USB drive, 
* a. Create directory `EFI` at the top 
* b. Create directory `BOOT` under `EFI` 
* c. Copy `modGRUBShell.efi` under `EFI\BOOT` and rename it to: `bootx64.efi`
* 3.  Reboot and enter BIOS, and from the Boot menu, boot using the USB drive. Selecting the USB drive under Boot Override (“UEFI: SanDisk, Partitions 1” in this example will do that):

https://preview.redd.it/ao8t9zejyr371.jpg?width=444&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0b7a3f86a01fac457d47d6646a01e665419d95c

* 4.  This should take you to `grub&gt;` prompt. Once, there, type: *(Warning: Your BIOS may need a different value than* `0x3a`*, depending on what was found in Phase 1)*  
`setup_var_cv QFan 0x3a`  
This does not change any setting; it just lets you see what is currently stored. You should see “`offset 0x3a is: 0x3c`” (`0x3c` being the current value, which is 60 in decimal indicating the middle temperature setting). If you don’t see this, something is not right and you may want to stop here.
* 5.  **We are now ready to make the change**. To do this, type: *(Warning: Your BIOS may need a different value than* `0x3a`*, depending on what was found in Phase 1)*  
`setup_var_cv QFan 0x3a 0x01 0x50`  
which means change variable `0x3a` within the `QFan` Varstore to value `0x50` (80 in decimal). The `0x01` means it is a one byte change. Steps 4 and 5 should look like this screenshot:

https://preview.redd.it/oc3qmmsi3s371.png?width=446&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=478dd67232ca6c21e461dd29232e17897df5ba33

* 6.  The change is now made. But for it to take effect, you must hard boot. Hold the power key until the computer shuts down then power it back up. 
* 7.  Enjoy the quiet.",False,40,0,1,0

X4 used by chipset, so only x4 left.

I have a 500gb ssd for boot and a 2tb ssd for gaming. Both are gen 4. 
I care more about gaming than doing other things with the pc. First of all, which ssd should I put in the M1A(top) slot of my x570 aorus master? Am I right to think that my 2tb gaming ssd should be in M1A, and my  boot/random stuff ssd should be in slot M2A?

If I go with this configuration, does one of the m.2 drives share with the cpu or something, leaving x4 for the second ssd, and no room for anything else(wtf?)

Let me know if I have this correct. Seems insane that new processors have 24 lanes. Some x570 motherboards have 3 pcie 4.0x16 slots. I guess thats really only good for sharing design with their Z platforms, and if something were to happen to the first slot, you have a backup.

Amd,Beginner question to tuning.,"I'll get straight to the point. I'm new to PC gaming, but super fascinated in the technology and I can't keep the curiosity of tuning my GPU/CPU out of my head. I have a Radeon 5700 XT. Max frequency I have is set to 2000 at 1095 volts.  I have VRAM clock speed set to 1800. I think all of that is safe. My main question here is, what should I NOT push these things to? My card is right from AMD by the way.

I went with the Thermal Grizzley minus 8 1.5mm pad which i tested, and it compresses down to 1mm with no issue.

Amd,"GPU Shortages, AM5, and the future: discussion on building","Hello everyone, just a rando PC fan.

About 6\~ weeks ago, I placed an order on a respected PC builder website for a 3060/3900x PC build (for editing, more VRAM is great, and the 12 core CPU is also). Anyways, Initially I was quoted around a 4 week wait, but I feel like the situation is getting worse, and they did recently offer to replace the 3060 for a 2060 for a discount (no way, never!) to speed up builds.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, what I've had the time to think about, after considering all this, is if I should just cancel it. I mean, I \*have\* a ASUS G14 with a 6 GB 2060 and an 8-core 4900HS... After waiting so long, and really, still being able to still get the work done I need (and gaming ofc), would it not just better at this point to cancel it and wait for the AM5 CPUs?  


Now, I know this is an age old question about ""should I wait"", but think it's worth a revist, simply due to GPUs not existing. Considering the fact that GPU prices are high, stocks are ultra low, and the fact that this is the last (?) AM4 generation CPUs, do all these factors push you towards waiting a year, in order to give a chance to:  


a) Alleviate GPU supply issues  
b) Have new GPU generations anyways   
c) Invest into a new AMD socket, giving you multiple more years of upgrades  
d) get into DDR5, possibly?  
e) FSR incoming, my main push to NVIDIA is DLSS, not RTX (that's the ""lose half frame rate"" button). If AMD is proposing a solution to boost frame rates like DLSS, I have no trouble going for AMD GPUs now, as they naturally offer higher VRAMs anyways (yay video editing!).

On its own, the AM5 may not have pushed me, but with all the other things happening, I'm now considering putting in a refund and cancelling my order. What do you think?",False,17,0,1,0

Amd,Need some help setting up PBO,"So I just got a Ryzen 7 3800XT for my Gigabyte X370 Gaming 5 motherboard. I'm on the latest BIOS with AGESA 1.0.0.6.

When I set PBO to enabled in BIOS nothing changes, I only get a boost when I use the EDC 1 bug but apparently this is not considered safe since it disables the high current detection.

With PBO enabled, on auto or with custom PPT, TDC and EDC values other than EDC 1 I get exactly the same scores and clocks as with PBO disabled. Shouldn't I see at least a little change?

With the EDC bug I get around 100 MHz higher all-core boost and around 50 MHz higher single-core boost. This translates to around 40 points higher CB15 MT scores and 3-4 points higher ST scores. Voltage during all-core loads is around 1.32-1.33 Volts when using this bug.

Have I missed some other setting to get PBO to work right? Does anyone here maybe have experience with Ryzen 3000 PBO on this board?

CTR rates my processor as a golden sample and gets me 4.4 GHz all-core at 1.25 Volts so PBO should definitely do something, right? On stock I get all-core boosts to around 4.275 GHz.

&amp;#x200B;

Here I was happy I finally installed my new cooler and would finally get some extra performance with CTR.

Alas, as usual I am met with the fact that reality is disappointing.

&amp;#x200B;

The program itself seems to not know what kind of CPU I have, as it cannot make up it's mind whether it's a bronze, silver or gold CPU.

&amp;#x200B;

So far it seems to add values seemingly randomly, as my current post-crash profile which it created indicates that my Ryzen 5 5600X should be running at 5050Mhz on High PX profile. There is obviously no way this CPU is capable of running at 5050Mhz even with a full blast load temp of 47 degrees and choked full of voltage.

&amp;#x200B;

It looks like it's doing something until it reaches AVX Light load testing, at which point it finishes the first test, starts the second test and immediately reboots my PC. This renders the entire diagnostic obsolete so far.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I tried going to Advanced mode and setting the diagnostic voltage from 1187mV to 1225mV which only seemed to have given a massive increase to PX High speeds but continued in crashing before finishing the diagnostics.

I also tried setting the polling rate to 1500.

Also pretty funny how it thinks my CPU goes over 5GHz when the max frequency in the advanced settings is set as 4900Mhz.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I'm not sure what the issue is. I set my vdroop settings to High as instructed after loading optimized defaults, and my memory only has XMP active (altho even without XMP it still crashes).

&amp;#x200B;

After months of trying to get a graphic card at a reasonable price, I was able to purchase an RX 6800XT off of the AMD store on June 3rd. But the invoice and the order number did not show up for hours and made me worried. So I contacted AMD support and was told not to worry about it. It will ship soon, but the next day after getting the order confirmation email, AMD decided to cancel my order with the reason listed as ""Other"" and ruin my whole day.

After getting in touch with the support, they could not find the exact reason behind the cancelation and asked me to place another order! The support's main idea behind the cancelation was maybe an anti-fraud measure triggered by the system. But the transaction went through PayPal without any issue. All the address information and billing information on my account is confirmed. Also the payment processor, Digital River, has no clue why the order got canceled. They suggested contacting AMD for a solution.

Now the question is how I am going to place another order when there is no stock? If there is a problem with an order, why not contacting the buyer? Instead of just canceling the order.

I have seen many scalpers and bots getting multiple cards from AMD without a single problem, but I can't have one card as an average gamer. How is this fair?

Has anyone had their order canceled by AMD and found a solution? Are there any mods here that can help? Please do share your opinion.",False,11,0,1,0

So I've undervolted with PBO in the bios, setting all cores negative curve with a value of 25 in the Curve Optimizer Magnitude field;  
Now I'm on 84C running a MC Cinebench R23, with a score of 15798 and clocks between 4849-4851 Mhz;  
On a single-core run I've scored 1603 Pts at 49-51C;  


Now I'm curious about 2 things:  
1) I've heard that in MSI Bios every unit in the Curve Optimizer Magnitude field equals to 3 to 5 Millivolts, is It the same in the Aorus Bios?  
2) Someone had the same issues/went through the same procedure? What values Have you put? Did you set the curve for all cores or have you set different values per core(s) ?

Amd,Hardware Leak Tracker - The Who's Who of Leaks,"[Link to spreadsheet at the bottom of this post]

I thought I'd share my own work that I've been doing in determining who is a good leaker and who isn't, based on the claims they've made and whether or not they come true or not. 

It took me many months to compile all the data and I wanted to be able to know without a doubt who are the 'guess-timators' pulling numbers out of the air, who actually have consistent and reliable sources, and who is just following the trends and using their own analysis to try to cut through the weeds.

While it may seem like it's a very subjective whether someone is making a claim or not, or whether someone it just speculating, or just making discussion, etc, I put together a set of very strict rules as to how I count claims and also how I verify them. The rules are listed in the summary of results tab so you can look at them and see how the data is represented.

In the end, the idea was to simply score each leaker by the % of the number of claims they got right.

The data covers all leaks that have been made by each of the known sources, as far back as I could go. For some leakers this data stretches all the way back to before the Zen1 years. For most twitter leakers, this only goes back to 2018 or so.

I know that there are still some very popular leakers out there that I haven't covered. But honestly, doing only a couple channels was hard enough going through all the videos (but it was fun/cringey sometimes as well). I don't want to go through like 4 or 5 more channels..it's just simply too much time, and, honestly, I hadn't planned on sharing this project except for maybe the results page. But here it is anyway. 

I also hadn't added any well-known forum leakers, as that is a huge mess going through posts that are scattered all over the place. So mainly it's just twitter, Youtube, and some specific websites.

The last time I updated the sheet for new leaks was sometime in the beginning of Feb 2021, so new leaks since then have not been added. However, I have just gone through all of the leaks that were added before then and verified any that could be verified, so it is an up-to-date account of the leaks, verified against the information that we have from products that have been released up to today.

The results speak for themselves. You can dig into the data page as well to see specific leaks that have been verified. I should also note that leaks that are behind a paywall have been hidden, but are still counted in the results page.

I won't be updating the list anymore, so this is the Who's Who as of Feb 2021. Some people have gotten better at leaking, some have gotten worse, some have just remained bad. But I hope everyone can use this to determine who is and isn't dependable when it comes to spilling the beans, and be able to make a decision for themselves whether a leak is likely to be true or not, at least in part, based on who is the one doing the leaking.

If anyone wants to take this data and make a cool looking spreadsheet or infographic, be my guest.

[So, without further ado, here are the results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oLA4RgOVlXa3_GWkFIcgUCnLzdQbADHkaXSOtN1UxRo/edit?usp=sharing)

There's been a lot of commotion in the sub and on twitter about the changes to Rule 6 for this sub, so I thought I'd share my own work that I've been doing in determining who is a good leaker and who isn't, based on the claims they've made and whether or not they come true or not. 

It took me many months to compile all the data and I wanted to be able to know without a doubt who are the 'guess-timators' pulling numbers out of the air, who actually have consistent and reliable sources, and who is just following the trends and using their own analysis to try to cut through the weeds.

While it may seem like it's a very subjective whether someone is making a claim or not, or whether someone it just speculating, or just making discussion, etc, I put together a set of very strict rules as to how I count claims and also how I verify them. The rules are listed in the summary of results tab so you can look at them and see how the data is represented.

In the end, the idea was to simply score each leaker by the % of the number of claims they got right.

The data covers all leaks that have been made by each of the known sources, as far back as I could go. For some leakers (mainly SemiAccurate and Adored) this data stretches all the way back to before the Zen1 years. For most twitter leakers, this only goes back to 2018 or so.

I know that there are still some very popular leakers out there that I haven't covered. Mainly Youtube leakers like MLID and Coreteks are the ones that come to mind. But honestly, doing AdoredTV leaks was hard enough going through all the videos (but it was fun/cringey sometimes as well). I don't want to go through MLID or Coreteks videos as well..it's just simply too much time, and, honestly, I hadn't planned on sharing this project except for maybe the results page. But here it is anyway. 

I also hadn't added any well-known forum leakers, as that is a huge mess going through posts that are scattered all over the place. So mainly it's just twitter, Youtube, and some specific websites.

The last time I updated the sheet for new leaks was sometime in the beginning of Feb 2021, so new leaks since then have not been added. However, I have just gone through all of the leaks that were added before then and verified any that could be verified, so it is an up-to-date account of the leaks, verified against the information that we have from products that have been released up to today.

The results speak for themselves. You can dig into the data page as well to see specific leaks that have been verified. I should also note that leaks that are behind a paywall (i.e. SemiAccurate leaks) have been hidden.

I won't be updating the list anymore, so this is the Who's Who as of Feb 2021. Some people have gotten better at leaking, some have gotten worse, some have just remained bad. But I hope everyone can use this to determine who is and isn't dependable when it comes to spilling the beans, and be able to make a decision for themselves whether a leak is likely to be true or not, at least in part, based on who is the one doing the leaking.

[So, without further ado, here are the results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oLA4RgOVlXa3_GWkFIcgUCnLzdQbADHkaXSOtN1UxRo/edit?usp=sharing)

Amd,Gamedevs are all doing Ray Traced lighting wrong,"Every Game with Ray Tracing they are trying to show off how many lights they can have and how nice they make them and it ends up being too intensive to actually be worth it.

We don't have strong enough hardware to actually do that yet. However something Devs should be doing is trying to have RT on a few specific objects where the impact wouldn't be soo bad.

___
Picture a game like Halo now imagine Ray Traced lighting just on something like the energy Sword and maybe on some of the lights on Spartan/Enemy armors but not on the entire lighting of the scene. Now this shouldn't have near the impact of fully global illumination lighting and it could improve the area's where regular rasterization lighting fails the hardest on.

In most scenes this would have very little impact on FPS and the benefit would be noticeable.

___

I get that every Dev wants to show how nice their game looks but the issue is tech isn't there yet. Focus on the little things with Ray Tracing.

Amd,"Opinion: AMD great jump in HPC space should be better Windows driver, NOT W6800 or Instinct MI100","So, these days, more and more information about the W6800 is flying around. I have followed AMD and been on this sub for long enough to conclude that: absolutely nothing will change.

Nvidia will keep their name on Workstation, HPC, ML if AMD keeps doing what they are doing, which is basically giving the middle finger to the professional Windows user space. From the bug-full Radon ProRender for the W6800 line to the ""up-yours-Windows"" ROCm development platform for AMD Instinct.

It has been said times to time that since Windows held most of the PC market, if new comers approach their work with a Nvidia product, they will likely to keep using Nvidia product. However, apart from AMD's inability or unwillingness to work with Windows, there is also a Linux cult that echoed AMD's action by valid arguments like: ""Windows suck"", ""If you want real work, use Linux"", ""HPC is for Linux. Period"".

Like how has the result been for AMD with that logic so far? As an IT engineer myself, I would say in our fields, there are many talents people. However, they are so talented that they are blinded by their ego, and basically say ""f\*\*\*-you"" to any other opinion. Yes, ""technically"", HPC works better with Linux, but not everything is about ""technical"".

I am not saying that if AMD spends time on expanding Windows driver and compatibility for HPC GPUs product, they can dethrone Nvidia. However, seeing that HPC is more focus on Linux by both companies, if AMD spends more time optimizing for Windows, at least they have a chance as they are fighting on a new battlefield.",False,9,0,1,0

Amd,I think Big Navi was just a proof of concept of AMD's MCM Active Chiplet,"I was reading through AMD's patent filing for [active bridge chiplet with integrated cache](https://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2021/0097013.html) when one snippit stuck out to me. 

""an active bridge chiplet 118 communicably couples the GPU chiplets 106 (i.e., GPU chiplets 106-1 through 106-N) to each other. Although three GPU chiplets 106 are shown in FIG. 1, the number of GPU chiplets in the chiplet array 104 is a matter of design choice and varies in other embodiments, such as described in more detail below. In various embodiments, such as discussed below in more detail with respect to FIG. 2, the active bridge chiplet 118 includes an active silicon bridge that serves as a high-bandwidth die-to-die interconnect between GPU chiplet dies. Additionally, the active bridge chiplet 118 operates as a memory crossbar with a shared, unified last level cache (LLC) to provide inter-chiplet communications and to route cross chiplet synchronization signals.""

This sounds a lot like the infinity cache introduced in RDNA2. RDNA2 also happens to effectively be a doubling of RDNA, with an added last level cache. I decided to go look up some block diagrams of the 2 RDNA µarchs and compare. Sure enough, when comparing between both [RDNA](https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15206/Navi_14_Unofficial.png) and [RDNA2](https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16303/Navi21_BD.png) (Images courtesy Anandtech reviews of RDNA [here](https://www.anandtech.com/show/15206/the-amd-radeon-rx-5500-xt-review) and RDNA2 [here](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16303/lauching-today-amds-radeon-rx-6900-xt)), RDNA2 looks like 2 RDNA chips mirrored end to end with a last level ""infinity cache"" connecting them. A more low level [block diagram](https://tpucdn.com/gpu-specs/images/g/923-block-diagram.jpg) courtesy [Techpowerup](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/amd-navi-21.g923) seems to confirm this. 

Its quite possible that RDNA2 was basically just a tweaked RDNA in order to test out the concept of a last level cache to synchronize multiple GPUs. This would likely explain the negligible difference between RDNA and RDNA2 when compared core to core and clock to clock as in [Techspot's clock for clock comparison test](https://www.techspot.com/review/2218-radeon-6700-xt-vs-5700-xt/#:~:text=For%20now%20at%20least%2C%20the%20key%20performance%20advantage,clock%20is%202581%20MHz%2C%20a%20substantial%2035%25%20increase.).

If RDNA2 is any indication, AMD are remarkably close to [having linear gains](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-radeon-rx-6900-xt/30.html) by doubling up cores.

With the recent demo, they essentially slapped a second layer of that L3 cache on top of it, doubling the total capacity.

Looking at Big Navi, the L3 cache surrounds the cores:

https://preview.redd.it/2qkh1ivt48371.png?width=1401&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fc69b13294b3f91a4e8f8b42f6024c633f83288

The current layout may be unsuitable for stacking, but the cache does take a big potion of that chip as well...

I suspect that AMD will try to get rid of that L3 on-die cache entirely and only rely on stacked V-Cache to provide the L3 cache entirely in the future. That way, the die can shrink even more, which is especially useful at low yields when adopting new nodes early or big die designs like big navi.

There might even be an additional latency improvement for L3 access, due to it being physically being closer to the cores, being stacked right on top of it.

Amd,New build help !,"Hi everyone, am rly eager to build a new pc for gaming(wow,dota-2,w3) with 2k 144hz monitor  + compiling code(android+ios), so am thinking of going for amd, mainly the r7 5800x or r9 5900x(but its really expensive with mobo ) 

but i cant deny that intel's 11th gen are priced very competitively,

for example the i7 11700K outperforms the 5800x and is around 100$ cheaper.

On the other hand I could just go for the r5 5600x for 200$ and it'd still be miles better overall compared to my current setup.

Also whatever cpu I pick, it's corresponding mobo and ram prices will take a cut from my future gpu budget (aiming for rx 6800xt level card)

I should add am upgrading to a new pc from an i7 4770 and 1600z ram and an rx 580, am aiming for 32gb ram alongside whatever cpu get since I compile android and iOS code(on virtual machine) so virtualization is important to me.

Amd,New AMD Patent Application Sheds Light on their Chiplet-GPU Implementation,"[Here is a link to the patent app](https://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2021/0158599.html)

When the first MGPU patent application was released, there were a few questions over how the chiplets would interact with each other, as well as with the CPU. There was also the question of whether or not there would be extra latency involved in this setup, and other questions such as how VRAM is handled. 

But first of all I want to make something abundantly clear, that goes against what RGT and a few other leakers are saying: **Nowhere in this patent application, or in any other chiplet GPU patent application written by AMD, is there an IO Die required for chiplet GPUs**. A lot of people may say 'well patents aren't always what comes to market', but AMD is clearly taking a different approach, and all of the patent applications to date imply that the approach is to *not use an IOD* at all. 

Now for some tasty (and long) bullet points:

* Fig. 6 shows three dies in the configuration. And to me, it seems that three-chiplet configuration is very likely. Not only because of this patent application, but also because of the fact that 3 dies is the maximum that TSMC can do with their [CoWoS-L](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16031/tsmcs-version-of-emib-lsi-3dfabric) (TSMC version of EMIB) tech at the moment. In fact, 3-die CoWoS-L is entering mass production in Q2 2021, which is almost right on schedule, if not a bit early, to put it into use for Navi 31. It should be noted that up to 8x HBM2E can also be connected with the 3x logic dies via CoWoS-L, but I don't think it's likely that this will happen for gaming. Especially with the infinity cache, I doubt HBM2E will be used at all. I should also add that all patent applications point to using an active silicon bridge (EMIB / CoWoS-L) in their designs and not a full silicon interposer. (See paragraph [0021], *""An active bridge chiplet couples the GPU chiplets to each other...includes an active silicon bridge that serves as a high-bandwidth die-to-die interconnect between GPU chiplet dies*). It is worth saying, though, that these patent applications don't specifically rule out more (or less) than 3 dies per package.

* As was made clear in the first chiplet GPU patent app, the CPU only talks directly to **one** of the GPU chiplets, and the entire chiplet-GPU appears as one singular GPU to the system. The first chiplet dispatches the work across the other chiplets via active bridge chiplet that includes L3 and also synchronizes the chiplets. (See paragraph [0022], ""..the CPU is coupled to a single GPU chiplet through the bus, and the GPU chiplet is referred to as a 'primary' chiplet. "")

* VRAM access: Each chiplet has it's own set of memory channels, as indicated in paragraph [0022] ""Subsequently, any inter-chiplet communications are routed through the active bridge chiplet as appropriate to access memory channels on other GPU chiplets"". The question here is if the chiplet GPUs have their own memory channels, are those memory channels exclusive to that chiplet or are they shared somehow? This is semi-resolved in paragraph [0026]: *""The memory-attached last level L3 cache that sits between the memory controller and the GPU chiplets avoids these issues by providing a consistent 'view' of the cache and memory to all attached cores""*. So where, physically, are the memory channels? A: They are on each chiplet. All memory access is controlled by the first chiplet, but memory channels are attached to L3. It should be noted that memory bandwidth scales directly with the # of chiplets on package. So for example, if a 1-chiplet GPU was built to have a 128-bit memory bus, a 2-chiplet GPU would have 256-bit...no more and no less.

* Checkerboarding: In the end of paragraph [0023], states ""...Mutually exclusive sets of adjacent pixels are processed by the different chiplets, which is referred to herein as 'checkerboarding' the pixels that are processed by the different GPU chiplets"". This harkens back to the days of SFR (split frame rendering) vs. AFR (alternate frame rendering) when rendering over crossfire / SLI. However it seems like these 'sets' of pixels will be much smaller, and not based on a simple line drawn across the screen. This should prevent screen tearing and other post-processing problems associated with SFR. According to [0049] *""Each pixel (/checkerboard) ... represents a work item that is processed in a graphics pipeline. Sets of pixels are grouped into tiles having dimensions of N pixels x M pixels. Mutually exclusive sets of the tiles are assigned to different process units""*, and, further on, in [0050] *""After the pixel work items are generated by rasterization, the processing units determine which subset two [sic] process based on a comparison of the unit identifier and the screen space location of the pixel.""*, it seems to indicate that the delineation of work between the chiplets happens at the primitives level, and not at the screen-space level. This could potentially eliminate the problems that occur with post-processing effects while rendering in SFR mode, and would allow each chiplet to effectively work on different parts of the same frame.

* Chiplet Synchronization: From [0024], *""...Command processors in the GPU chiplets detect synchronization points in the command stream and stop (or interrupt) processing of commands in the command buffer until all the GPU chiplets have completing [sic] processing commands prior to the synchronization point"".* Again, if a single chiplet is saturated, all of the chiplets have to wait for it to catch up. However, with checkerboarding, it's doubtful whether the workload will vary so greatly between chiplets that this will become and issue. 

* Active Bridge Chiplet: From [0026], *""...the active bridge chiplet includes a unified cache that is on a separate die than the GPU chiplets, and provides an external unified memory interface that communicable links two or more GPU chiplets together"".* The two points here being that 1) the entire L3 cache sits on the active silicon bridge itself, and nowhere on the GPU chiplets, and, 2) that the memory channels are on each chiplet (as stated above), but are controlled by only the first chiplet.

* Memory Controller: From Fig. 6, it's pretty clear that a memory controller exists on the first chiplet. However, this same memory controller would still 'physically' exist on the other 'slave' chiplets, but would be disabled and not used. Anyone familiar with chip fabrication knows that making 2 different designs instead of one involves two costs: 1) the cost of making separate designs in the first place, making a 2nd set of masks, etc, and 2) the cost associated with the loss of scalability of the design. So although the patent application doesn't explicitly mention that there won't be a separately-designed 'IO die', it is quite clear that each of the chiplets in this multi-chiplet GPU are identical, and that there will be some dark silicon on each die.",False,76,0,0,0

We all favour open discussion and want /r/AMD to be a place with as minimal rules or restrictions about what can be posted, while still maintaining interesting user discussion regarding speculation and rumors.

Rule 6 used to read

---

&gt; ""No unsubstantiated rumors - rumors or other claims/information not directly from reputable sources must have evidence to support them. Any rumor or claim that is just a statement from an unknown source containing no supporting evidence will be removed.""

---

Rule 6 will now read

---

&gt; ""Do not post or crosspost unsubstantiated rumors, leaks or claims as news from random Twitter, Reddit or other forum accounts.""

---

And before anyone asks, Rule 6 will not cover Twitter accounts like kopite7kimi, OMACHI_ENSAKA, momomo_us and similar, these accounts and other similar accounts not mentioned are well known leakers with good track records and are often cited by the likes of VideoCardz, TechPowerUP, OC3D and more.

Rule 6 is targeted at post like 'my dad works at AMD and has insider knowledge and he said the 7900 XT' etc...

Anything not confirmed by AMD should be treated as a rumor with varying amounts of salt taken depending on the claim and source.

Along with this change, the ban on WCCFTech and has been lifted. In discussion with the other moderators we've agreed they are no better or worse than many other websites and publications that are allowed on here, the ban was also circumvented whenever a video from WCCFTech's YouTube channel was posted and there were exceptions to the original ban, such as the article being an exclusive, review or translation.

These changes won't be popular with everyone, but these rules better reflect our vision for the sub and changes to our community, for which /r/AMD has more than doubled in size over the last year.

We encourage everyone to treat rumors as rumors and to take a grain of salt with anything not officially confirmed by AMD.

Amd,Are there any new ways to deal with the weird color auto-adjustment that Chromium browsers seem to always do when playing videos?,"I'm not sure if this is more suited for r/AMDHelp (if so, remove, I will post there) but for a while, I have been getting this issue where I play a video (Netflix, Youtube, etc.) in a chromium browser (Chrome or Edge, etc.), and the colors auto-adjust every time I put the tab with the video into focus. I've only had my 5600x/6800xt for a couple of months now, but I do not recall this always being an issue.

Through some googling, I messed with hardware acceleration. If I turn that off it does remedy the issue and the colors do NOT adjust, however, I dunno if that's worthwhile or not as hardware acceleration does seem to have a minor benefit.  I tried messing with the force color profile in chrome settings and none of the options sort the matter out. I've DDU'd and installed different Radeon software versions (21.3.2 is my preferred one, which is what I am currently on) and it happens on all of them, it seems (tried 23.3.1, 21.3.2, 21.4.1, and the optional ones you can currently get I forget the numbers to).

Any other alternatives I should be aware of? I'm not sure if there is something in Radeon settings maybe? My video profile has always been on default, for what it's worth.

I recall having an old Samsung Note 3 long ago that did something like this with an enhanced video setting. A simple toggle off and it went away. I can't seem to find anything else like that except for disabling hardware acceleration in Chrome's settings.

For what it's worth, this doesn't happen on browsers like Firefox, but I will admit I do like Chrome a bit more and I prefer to use it if I can. I suppose if this can't be sorted I'll move to Firefox for the time being, but I, of course, would prefer not to.",False,1,0,1,0

Amd,"Can future uses of X3D involve stacking on the I/O die? Would an I/O die with cache be an option, or would that cost too much?","So, I've been reading a lot of articles on Semi Engineering, IEEE and Semi Wiki about 3D stacking for a while, and [Dr. Cutress's article about the V-Cache announcement](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16725/amd-demonstrates-stacked-vcache-technology-2-tbsec-for-15-gaming) mentioned the possibility of putting the SRAM *underneath* logic instead, which would be better for cooling, but make it harder to deliver power to the logic.

But logic doesn't just need power, it also needs I/O. IIRC, the biggest idle power draw on Zen2 and Zen3 chiplets is the connection between the CCD and the I/O die, and that's the biggest source of latency as well, mainly on Zen2, but Zen3 still experiences it with chiplet-to-chiplet communication, even if it has to go chiplet-to-chiplet less often than Zen2 did.

If only there was a way to make communication between the I/O die and the CCDs faster and more efficient, maybe by travelling over a shorter distance...

Current X3D stacking and V-Cache rely on cache-on-cache stacking, because cache doesn't get as hot as logic does. I don't know how hot the PHY for I/O gets, but given that the x570 chipset needs a fan, and it's the same die design as the Zen2 and Zen3 I/O die, I imagine it gets a little bit hot.

In RDNA2, the ""Infinity Cache"" is a Last Level Cache that's physically closer to the GDDR6 memory controllers, so there seem to be some advantages to having cache and I/O closer together, for latency and power efficiency reasons.

The idea I had after reading the article: Make an I/O die with all the memory controllers, PCIe, USB and everything else, and put a big chunk of SRAM in the middle of it. Then, stack a CCD with CPU cores or GPU Compute Units, or both on top of the SRAM, and connect it to the I/O die with TSVs.

The main problem I see with this idea is that it would be a sort of reversal of the current paradigm, where AMD's I/O dies are the cheap dies made on older nodes.

Because I/O doesn't shrink very well, and SRAM cache doesn't either. The biggest improvement to I/O density in a while now has been TSMC's 5nm node, where I/O got a 1.2x density improvement. For their 3nm node, logic gets a 1.7x density improvement, SRAM gets 1.2x, and I/O gets 1.1x.

Putting SRAM and I/O, the two things that aren't shrinking super well, on the same die, might not be ideal from a cost perspective. Even if you can save by not including as much SRAM on the CCDs, and include more logic instead. And that's not even getting into the packaging costs that 3D stacking will add over traditional 2D packaging and substrates.

I will say, though, that, from my understanding, (which might be totally wrong) my description of a sort of ""I/O + SRAM cache chiplet"" kinda sorta already exists? Because I'm pretty sure that's a lot like how FPGAs work. I'm pretty sure most FPGAs consist mainly of SRAM cells, lookup tables, and I/O.

If I'm understanding [this die shot](https://forums.xilinx.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/9607i3D9183A2867FDA2C/image-size/original?v=mpbl-1&amp;px=-1) and [this block diagram](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Architecture-of-SRAM-based-FPGA_fig1_322680101) correctly, an FPGA is a lot like how I pictured an SRAM+I/O die looking. Big SRAM in the center, I/O on the outside. Granted that the programmable data fabric and look-up tables in an FPGA are loads more complicated than ""just"" regular SRAM like everything else uses.

I'm sure AMD couldn't just take one of the existing Xilinx FPGAs and just start stacking Zen CCDs on top of it, there would probably have to be some re-engineering and design work involved. And they'd probably have to design the SRAM so that the TSVs can go through it properly, and they'd need to make sure the socket and software could communicate with the package properly and all of that. I assume that's probably why they didn't do it for the recent Zen3 + V-Cache announcement, because the AM4 socket and the Vermeer package were already laid out a certain way.

But does anyone see a problem with my assumption that I/O + cache would be ideal for the bottom level of a 3D-stacking solution?

Amd,"Super low CPU (Ryzen, 2700x) score in timespy (Scores at the bottom)"," 

So, ive been having really bad fps issues with this PC since ive had it, which is about 2 years ago now.

So I decided to run Timespy just to see and damn, the score from my Ryzen 2700x sucks. Compared to most other people using one my score is like, 3000+ points lower. My frames must be a CPU issue, ive changed my GPU with another of the same, didnt fix it, also the ram has been changed.

Ill post my specs below, along with my average frames with games and also a pic of my entire timespy results.

My Specs are as follows.

* RTX 2080TI (No overclock - Have tried and doesnt do anything)
* Ryzen 2700x (no overclock - Have tried and doesnt do anything)
* 16GB DDR4 @ 3200mhz
* Games installed on a NVME SSD
* Playing in 1080p @ 144hz

Average frames are as follows.

Biggest example: - I have been playing Days Gone, with my spec people have been getting frames with an average of 140fps, @ 1080p max settings. With Dips to no less than 100. Im getting an average of 70fps with dips into the low 50's all the time, lowest ive seen is 49fps thus far. Its not like its a stutter to that frame, its @ 49fps until I move away from that area, then when I come back the frames tank again, even then, the highest ive ever seen it go it 90, and thats in the middle of nowhere with nothing on screen. Even with everything happening benchmarks show specs like mine never dropping to 49, hell not even dropping below 100. This should NOT be happening with a PC like this.

* Call of Duty: Warzone - Average of 60fps with frequent dips to 52 fps @ 1080p (changing settings from highest to lowest settings does literally nothing).
* Call of Duty: Black Ops, Cold War - Average of 60fps with frequent dips to 55 fps @ 1080p (changing settings from highest to lowest settings does very little)
* Cyberpunk 2077 - Average of 40fps without raytracing, average of 30 with raytracing @ 1080p (Changing from highest to lowest settings only gives me about 10 more fps).
* Horizon: Zero Dawn - Average of 55fps @ 1080p, changing from highest to lowest settings nets me about 20fps giving me an average of 75fps but still dips below 60 in some areas).
* DayZ: Standalone - Average of 50fps @ 1080p, changing settings doesnt do anything.
* World of Warcraft - Average of 52fps @ 1080p (Changing from highest settings to the lowest settigns nets a huge performance gain, this is the only game that has this effect. Ill sit at about 100fps with everything as low as it can go)
* Valorant - Average of 120fps @ 1080p (Changing from highest to lowest settings changed the average to about 140fps, also @ 1080p)
* Escape from Tarkov - Average of 50fps @ 1080p with drops to 45fps fairly often (Changing settings does practically nothing)

Ive done everything you can think of to fix my frames.

So, does anyone here have any clue to whats going on, temps are always fine on both the GPU and CPU, so are the clock speeds. So no throttling, ive reinstalled windows countless times, even fresh install with nothing on my pc but drivers and one game to test, ive reset the cmos, clean drivers.

Im at a complete loss.

That's the stock cooler?! That's great temps!"" In there defense, I guess if it was high, they would of tried to sell me an aftermarket CPU cooler.

I'm a noob and just started playing with OC'ing my 5900x which is being cooled with a 240mm AIO.

My Bios on my Asus x570-i is set that PBO is set to Auto and my Curve Optimizer at -15 on all cores. I tried downloading Ryzen Master and creating a profile with Precision Boost Overdrive. The performance was gnarly with all cores hitting about 4.4-4.5ghz when running Cinebench R23. The only worry was the temps being 90C for 10 whole mins.

My question is, do I need to have PBO enabled in BIOS or should I turn that off if i use Ryzen Master? Second question is it safe to be running at 90C for extended periods of time on a 5900x?

I hope you and your loved ones are doing well in these unprecedented times.  
 

I am not sure how closely you have been following the cryptocurrency news recently. In case you have not joined the Pi Network yet, I am sending you an invitation.  
 

Pi is a new digital currency introduced on Pi Day (3/14) in 2019. It is a new type of blockchain technology developed at Stanford. It uses smartphones instead of computers. The ""mining"" process for each coin does not require solving puzzles, wasting energy, or using your phone data. You just mine it by tapping the app once a day to confirm you are human.  
 

As part of your invitation, I am sending you 1π!

To claim your Pi, download the Pi Network app (on an iPhone or Android device) and use my username (DrEEEEE) as your invitation code.  
 

Pi is not a scam. You can Google it, search for the core team members and view their published articles and citations on Google Scholar, view their social media to confirm network growth and updates, watch countless videos from many trusted sources explaining the technology and concept. The Pi Network channel on Youtube is hosted by the founders explaining the network and technology in the videos. You should also check out the comments and questions below those videos to see the intense enthusiasm and interest in this new project. Once you download the app, you can also view the latest information and messages from core team members, who are all Standford University Ph.D. and MBA recipients. The founder, my colleague Dr. Kokkalis, lectures a cryptocurrency course at Stanford, so their updates include the videos of these lectures as well. I have learned quite a lot from them just in the past few weeks since I joined.  
 

The network is growing quickly. It reached 14 million members last month. The core team members plan to close the network and end the mining process when the network reaches around 100 million members. At that time, you will be able to trade the Pi you have mined for actual currencies, just like Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. The members of the network will also be rewarded for any transaction fees collected and advertising revenue from their app. Also, their network is already open to programmers to develop apps specific to that network. All of the revenue generated will also be shared with the network members daily. The daily active users and the large ecosystem created by the network give Pi a certain value other cryptocurrencies do not possess.  
 

Pi was launched as a three-phase project. The first phase involved growing the network and mining a limited number of coins. The second phase of testing the network is already running. The third and final phase will be Mainnet. This is the phase where you can actually trade the Pi you have earned. The Mainnet phase is expected to be launched within months.   
 

As the network expands, the mining rate (currently 0.1 Pi per hour) is cut in half at each benchmark, such as 10 million, 100 million members, etc. This halving is intended to create the ""scarcity"" concept. Similar to Bitcoin, the total number of Pi created will be limited. I am sure you have heard the Bitcoin halving (mining rate being cut in half) last year created enormous demand, sending the price of one Bitcoin to over $61K recently! At this time, we don't know exactly how much each Pi will be worth once trading starts at the third phase of the project. Estimates range from a few cents to a few dollars per Pi. However, it is not unusual for a new cryptocurrency to experience 100 or even 1000-fold increases in value within a year. In case you are not familiar with cryptocurrency values, you can search historical prices for Bitcoin and Ether to see these exponential increases.

 Once you join the network, you will also be receiving 25% of the Pi I am mining daily as a bonus. This also applies to everyone who joins your team in the future. This incentive structure has helped them grow their network so quickly. The app also allows you to see how much your ""team"" is mining in real-time. Pretty exciting and engaging, in my opinion. You can currently mine almost 3 Pi a day with just me as your one team member to start. If you have a decent size network, that number can get much higher.  
 

Feel free to read the FAQ and white paper explaining the concept on their secure website, minepi dot com. Once you download the app you will need the invitation code DrEEEEE to create your account, since every member needs an invitation to sign up. When you accept you will see me listed as a verified member, under your Earning Team.  
 

Keep in mind that they are planning to close the network when they reach around 100 million members and the Pi mining rate will eventually be reduced to zero, limiting the total number of Pi in circulation and increasing the value of each Pi mined until then. The network growth rate so far seems to be around 20% a month and Pi already has more daily active users than any other cryptocurrency!   
 

If you have any questions about Pi, the technology, digital currencies, or finance in general, I am happy to help any time.  
 

Happy mining 😊",False,0,0,1,0

Amd,5900X PBO Curve vs VCore intuition,"I have dialed in a solid OC/undervolt on a 5900x with NH-D15 on a B550 Strix, with -0.05 VCore and 32GB 3600 CL15 B-die.  I can hit 22k on cinebench R23 when the room is cold with \~195W heat being moved around, but if I lower voltage more to reduce that, I run into motherboard EDC limits at 190A. The curve optimizer settings are lots of -30, 2nd best core at -25, best at -20.  I have to run LLC 3 or 4 to make this stable. I have a couple cores boosting past 5GHz with +150 offset and 1X scalar.

My question stems from the observation that I might have too many cores at -30. Is it an indication that some of those cores could go further than others and I just do not know which yet?  Would it make sense to start over dialing in curve offsets from a larger (eg -.1V) Vcore to push all the curve offsets up?  For example, what's -30 now might end up being a -15.  Usually curve is going to give you more of a benefit than a flat offset, but I bet I could lower my VCore a little and get better numbers overall.

Amd,Guys! I need your help to undervolt my GPU and have a couple of questions about temps!,"Hi!

I'm trying to undervolt my RX 6900 XT to reduce temps and noise. I currently have zero interest in overclocking as I only want to keep it at stock clocks and undervolt. I want to do it with the tools provided in the tuning tab of Adrenaline suite.

I currently tried the automatic undervolt and played for 30-40 min Red Dead Redemption 2 and I noticed fps drops in Saint Denis at night to even 70 fps. I then restored the voltage settings and played again and was back at 90-100 fps in the same conditions.

I have also installed MSI Afterburner but I use it only for the osd. Not a single setting was changed about GPU clocks/voltage/fans. Do I have to uninstall MSI Afterburner?

I have this GPU for a month now, here are the temps (max column in HWInfo) as of now (default fan curve):

* GPU average (edge) temp reaches 77-79 °c. Only one time reached 80 °c.
* GPU Junction temp reaches about 95 °c. In the last 2 days reached 100 °c.

Amd,6900 XT temperature behavior,"Good day,

I recently bought a Sapphire RX 6900 XT Nitro+ SE, but I am concerned about the temperatures.

It  behaves very strangely. As soon as I start a game the temperatures  immediately go up to 110 degrees celsius, as soon as I close the game  the temperature immediately drops to 60 degrees.

I have the fear sapphire has forgotten to apply thermal paste, or the contact to the heatsink is missing.

Are  the temperatures much too high, is the behavior normal, should I have  the GPU replaced or try to take the GPU apart myself and apply new  thermal paste? Do you have a guess as to what this is?

The GPU isn't even in a case at the moment, so airflow shouldn't be a problem.

What makes me wonder is that the GPU gets so hot even with only 200W power draw.

Amd,Here's Why FSR Is Available For Competitor Cards &amp; Old AMD Cards Instead Of RX 6000+ Only,"If you already know why, or have came to the same conclusion as me feel free to disregard this post. It may seem obvious to a lot of people but with how often I see people upset or just asking why they did it I will explain.

As you know AMD is playing catch up with NVIDIA's DLSS, its just been out longer so more games support it. The reason old AMD cards and even NVIDIA cards get the feature too is because that means more people can and will use it, the more people that can and will use it the more demand it will have and popular it will be. A lot of games support DLSS so this is a quick way to catch up to the number of titles as NVIDIA sooner, if it was only for 6000 series cards it would take longer but now with RDNA 1, Polaris, GTX, etc people using it and demanding for it to be implemented it will be quicker. If you look at steams specs these older cards are most common, its a great strategy even if it ""incentivizes you"" not to get AMD because you can just use all their tech with nvidia plus nvidia's proprietary tech as well. 

Also since it is open source and everyone will have access to it, it will potentially speed up development for improvements because as is even in ultra quality mode it looks blurry and oily, nothing like native. People said it would be between DLSS 1 and 2 but its towards the lower end of that spectrum, like DLSS 1.2, still 0.8 off but idc if its not great right now because I have hope the amount of support and improvements coming will be great",False,31,0,1,0

Amd,Is the 5800x worth the money,"Hey Everyone, I'm currently running a 2700x CPU with an RTX 2060 on an Aorus Pro WiFi motherboard. I'm thinking that my next upgrade is going to be the CPU. 

My first question is how big of an improvement is it going from the Zen+ architecture to Zen3. I've watched benchmark videos, but I can't wrap my head around them sometimes. 

My second question is this. I like having the 8 Cores of the 2700x, but the price point for the new 5800x seems a little steep, especially compared the value of the 5600x or the only decently more expensive 5900x that gives you 12 freaking cores. I'm just not seeing the value in upgrading to the 5800x. I do stream games from my computer alongside doing some occasional audio and video editing, though not too much. I know the extra cores help with that kind of thing, so maybe it is worth saving the extra money for the 5800x. Or maybe I should save even MORE and go ith the 5900x. What do y'all think? Would the 5600x fit my needs?

Amd,Let us undervolt/overclock/RAM tune our Ryzen Mobile 5000 CPUs (looking at you Intel 11th Gen…),"Hello!

Since Intel seems to back in game with their latest 11th Gen CPUs it‘s kind of weird that:

1. There is no undervolting on my 5900HX possible (Curve Optimizer anyone?!)

2. You can’t overclock the HX series CPUs

3. You can’t run XMP or modify the RAM timings in any way. (Not even talking about voltages or frequency…just tightening up timings would be better than 22-22-22 @ 3200Mhz)

4. You can’t adjust the Infinity Fabric Clock.

This makes the “AMD Package” look kind of outdated in 2021 against what Intel offers. I know Multicore and Battery Life are (probably) vastly superior on AMD CPUs, but for the high-end gamer it’s kind of sad…

I also have a desktop with an AMD 5800H and I tuned it to “perfection”…3800Mhz IF, Curve Optimizer for every single core, RAM timings for primary, secondary and even tertiary timings…so I know that it’s possible with enough time and persistence.

PLEASE AMD: Give ODMs the option to provide end users with an “unlocked” BIOS!

Thank you and don’t let your lead be taken away by Intel so easily…

PS: Yes, there are risks involved in all those tuning options - you can brick your fancy Laptop really fast, BUT I know that some ODMs already provide “reset/backup” solutions for a bricked BIOS on their machines. So give ODMs/Users the option to take the risk if they wish to do so!

Trying to upgrade to a PC that can handle both Gaming and Streaming at the same time. GPU availability looks 100x worse than what it was in 2018 (can't believe I was complaining back then looking at today's situation).

Basically my only option is to upgrade my CPU to a 5800x + B550i (would really like a 5900x but can't find it at msrp). Does anyone know if the 5800x and Vega 64 can handle live streaming a game like BF5, BF6, Warzone etc in 1440p resolution?

I know people are gonna say get an RTX for NVENC but they're all way overpriced so that's my only option right now :(

On another note, I wonder if I can re-use the 2600x as a dedicated streaming PC, but the only other GPU I have is a GTX 770 from ages ago (which I'm not even sure still works). But then I'll need an Elgato capture card which I don't think I can afford at the moment.",False,18,0,1,0

But like, Navi 21 has a 520mm^2 die and a 128MB Infinity Cache. Less than the 192MB of a 2-chiplet V-Cache. And the bandwidth for the Infinity Cache on RDNA2 is 1,664GB/s. Less than the 2TB/s of V-Cache.

Could Navi21 be smaller if it stacked V-Cache instead of including all the Infinity Cache on-die? Would that be cheaper? Make a relatively small 80CU GPU die (with I/O, and the L0, L1 and L2 caches) and then stack the 128MB Infinity Cache die on top of it? Or maybe under it? You're paying for 2 dies, but both of the dies are smaller than if everything was monolithic.

And for a while now, APUs have been held back by memory bandwidth constraints on the integrated graphics. V-Cache seems like the perfect solution.",False,55,0,1,0

[Imgur album with the screenshots for comparison:](https://imgur.com/a/duVWpaL)

[Imgsli direct comparison using one screenshot:](https://imgsli.com/NTY1MTQ)

The Ultra Quality results were very surprising, CAS did a very good job at putting them much closer to the native resolution by getting rid of the blurriness. While the lose of detail is something CAS can't do anything about, it does look good enough for me to consider it as a solid alternative to native resolution.

The Quality results, however, were way less impressive. They do look better than without CAS, but the downgrade in quality from native resolution is still very clear.

Take into consideration that because I'm sharpening frames from a video downloaded from YouTube, I'm also sharpening compression artifacts. For this reason the results would be a lot better in-game when using RIS instead of applying CAS to a heavily compressed screenshot. Because of that, this test is far from perfect, but it's the best I can do with the little I have.

I'm not a specialist, but i've seen since zen 2 a lot of posts related to the core arch and the cores not being fed enough data to being used properly. 

My guess is that zen 3 cores are even ""stronger"" in a sense and the new cache pool help alleviate that issue but not completely, which means the new bigger cache will also feed the cores enough. 

so by making cores stronger in the long term strategy they can just add more cache to feed them enough data and get better ipc easily.. once the whole process is mastered ?

Amd,"FidelityFX Super Resolution ""Ultra Quality"" comparisons","I tried posting these last night in a comment to the news post and I think that Reddit blocked it because I was using external links. I'd like to try again with attachments, since I think that some people may be interested.

I downloaded the FSR reveal video in 4K and saved a few keyframes of the ""Ultra Quality"" comparisons as BMPs. I then enlarged several areas 4x (without resampling) to show the differences more clearly (especially for those without 4K displays) and saved them in JPEG with 100% quality (because the BMPs were 30MB each). You may need to right click them and choose to open them in a new tab to see their full size and really spot the differences.

[Scene 1](https://preview.redd.it/sljv24mjxr271.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e1b21f7ec6ff4360ece1a55c5787429c6c568b8)

My personal takeaway is that, even with ""Ultra Quality"" mode on an RX 6800 XT, there's rather significant loss of detail and blurring. I'll be honest and note that I've never used DLSS, but I've seen image comparisons with DLSS 2.0 on and off and I find it a lot harder to spot differences in them than with FSR on and off here.

My aim here isn't to trash FSR. I'm glad that AMD is providing it, especially because I expect that they'll improve it over time. I just think that we shouldn't get our hopes up too high and assume that it'll rival DLSS when it debuts. Draw your own conclusions, though.

Amd,Possible repairs for Ryzen 5 2600,"Hello!

Recently, I upgraded my pc and decided to use the leftover parts to build my girlfriend a system.

I found a good deal on a Ryzen 5 2600 and ordered it. I shortly after accidentally placed it in the plastic shell backwards, which bent the pins. Using a razor and a 5mm mechanical pencil, I bent them back into shape and placed it into the system.

It worked, but the system would crash after running for some time. When it crashed, It is almost as if the reset button had been pushed- it turned off and immediately turned back on as if being turned on normally. I managed to get it to run a full benchmark, and it seems that it only crashes at idle or low usage.

I have fully troubleshot everything, and it is the CPU causing this, as replacing it with a different unit eliminated the crashing.

I was thinking that if I had caused damage to the pins, (which are clearly working) perhaps a bad contact is being made and I could use heat (an oven) to heat up the unit to possible help, as many have done with GPU's.

I was wondering what your thoughts on this are. Currently, I got a Ryzen 5 1600 to manage, But I would prefer the 2600 if you guys think this would be a viable option.",False,4,0,1,0

Amd,"RISC vs. CISC Is the Wrong Lens for Comparing Modern x86, ARM CPUs","The concept of ""RISC vs. CISC"" and ""x86 versus ARM"" are so tightly intertwined, if you Google ""x86 ARM"", all of the top hits from Google define ""x86 versus ARM"" in terms of ""CISC versus RISC."" These terms, however, are not a particularly useful way to think about modern microprocessors. 

This article (I'm the author) discusses the mid-1990s development of both AMD and Intel CPUs and how the initial controversy over the supposed RISC-like nature of modern x86 CPU developments got started. 

Intel is the company most commonly associated with the development of x86 micro-op decode and out-of-order execution engines, but the technique actually debuted with a NexGen CPU. AMD later bought NexGen, and the company's last CPU design became the K6. The AMD K5 (an in-house design) combined an x86 decoder with design elements lifted directly from the Am 29000, then one of the most popular RISC CPUs on the market.

Some folks in our data warehouse are running scripts on their VMs that open a dozen instances of Chrome and of course that grinds their workflow to a halt. We have contacted Dell and their solution is a Tesla T4 per host plus a Grid license for every VM running with acceleration. Well, I'm not a fan. I have looked into AMD because I know their SRI-OV capable cards run without said licenses but the only one I can get quoted from Dell is an M100 card that looks like I could use it to help make the next vaccine. I want something a little downmarket from that without the Nvidia tax. We have service agreements on all of our production hosts so I can't just buy a couple of used v340s from eBay and expect them to be supported. I'm wondering how others have handled what I think are light requirements for acceleration without an unlimited budget.

Amd,Is there any place to report retailers to AMD? They've stolen my RMA GPU.,"About a month or 2 ago, I shipped my Vega 56 off to it's retailer for RMA. The retailer has since tried to repair the card, failed, send it off to AMD, they failed, and AMD has returned to the retailer a working sample, and... That's where it stopped.


The retailer received the GPU, and is now simply not sending it back to me. They keep saying they have sent it to me and that it already arrived, whilst both me and the alleged postal company both are certain it wasn't shipped at all, and that it's a total lie. I have emailed back and forth for months with them and they just stopped responding after I called them out on their contradictory statements multiple times. They hang up on me when I call them. I even have audio recordings with our postman to confirm there was no such package.


I know GPU's are expensive and that they'd prefer not to RMA such a piece of expensive equipment when it was originally bought for less, but come on.

I've been without a PC for multiple months now as I have no iGPU, I missed any chance of studying for my exams in this now-online world, and as such had a little tear as I waved goodbye to my status as a probable honors student.

These insufferable actions of retailers to get a few hundred bucks more are damaging both the customer's trust in the retailer and their trust in AMD. If they can't insure I actually get my product, how am I to buy with certainty from them again?

Which I realize is a decent increase in Multicore, but single core is marginally better, compared to what I see other people getting. 

According to Ryzen Master, during the multi thread test, it’s pushing all cores to 4660Mhz and varies, single core gets 4800Mhz seemingly with a hard cap.

Am I just looking at the numbers wrong and I’m actually getting a sizable performance increase, or am I getting things mixed up and not applying the OC correctly?

I’m just curious what the census is a couple years in on PBO and Auto OC? 

I set the power conditions to motherboard and keep scalar to auto.

With these features enabled I get higher frequency’s across all cores , opposed to when it’s disabled and just single core runs at 4400ghz.

I help administer a VSphere cluster for a school district.  We have mostly Dell R740 nodes with plenty of RAM and CPU but never had a need for any 3D acceleration until recently.  Some folks in our data warehouse are running scripts on their VMs that open a dozen instances of Chrome and of course that grinds their workflow to a halt.  We have contacted Dell and their solution is a Tesla T4 per host plus a Grid license for every VM running with acceleration.  Well, I'm not a fan.  I have looked into AMD because I know their SRI-OV capable cards run without said licenses but the only one I can get quoted from Dell is an M100 card that looks like I could use it to help make the next vaccine.  I want something a little downmarket from that without the Nvidia tax.  We have service agreements on all of our production hosts so I can't just buy a couple of used v340s from eBay and expect them to be supported.  I'm wondering how others have handled what I think are light requirements for acceleration without an unlimited budget.

Amd,Is StoreMI corrupting your data?,"Hi folks,

So, earlier, I was looking to work on some photos in Lightroom. Here is how they looked:

https://preview.redd.it/tlnlq1jrah271.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14d341457230ccf0d281d26ea29001d419ce67e0

As you can see, that's not entirely the hazy Scottish sunset I'd quite intended on working with. I went digging to find out what had happened, and what the cause could be. So, with my diagnostics, here's what I ruled in, and here's what I ruled out:

* Just that file  - the issue actually appeared to be widespread, with thousands of newer files exhibiting corruption issues
* Source images - They all appear fine, loaded directly from the card into Lightroom. This rules out the source files, and also the reader, and the software
* Memory - A looong memory test reveals no issues. The system appears to have no stability issues of any kind. 
* Other drives - Of the system's four drives, there are three NVMe and one mech HDD, with the third NVMe acting as cache drive for the mech HDD. Files on the first two mech drives exhibit no corruption that I can find.
* Connection issues - I tried replacing the SATA cable and changing the port to which it was connected, which made no difference to the apparent corruption issue.
* StoreMI. This appears to be the culprit.

My method for testing is to create 100GB of test data (which was just my c:\\program files folder packed in to a RAR file), and run **certutil -hashfile ""test.rar"" MD5** on the file to generate an MD5 hash of the file's contents. What I consistently found was that the source file, regardless of how many times it was duplicated on either of the NVMe drives, returned the same hash value. All 100GB of its data was copying from drive to drive or drive within drive accurately. Meanwhile, copying the source to the StoreMI-bonded mech HDD consistently returned different hash values, meaning that every test file copied with different corruptions. 

I unbonded the mech HDD from its StoreMI cache drive, and uninstalled StoreMI. I then ran tests again. This time, every test came back good. I ran them a further ten times. Again, with StoreMI now removed from the system, data was written to and read from the drive with zero corruption, even out of hundreds of gigabytes of data. 

&amp;#x200B;

\---------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

If there are other StoreMI users reading this, I'd strongly recommend testing your StoreMI-accelerated drive for the same corruption. The easiest way to do this is to create a large test file (feel free to do what I did, and just find a large folder and add it to a WinRar archive - save time by creating the archive with 'Store' level compression, which averts the need for WinRar to do anything with the data but pack it into a single large file), put it in to a folder on your C:\\ drive called 'Test', create a folder on your StoreMI drive with the same name, and then run the script below as a .bat file. It'll take a long time for your system to copy and then read through this data, but doing so will give you MD5 hashes for each file, which you can use to test whether or not they're copying correctly or not. Identical MD5 hashes = a perfect copy, different MD5s = data corruption.

Amd,Ryzen 9 5900x &amp; NH-D15 = High Temperature. Share your results with air coolers," 

Hello,

Recently upgraded PC from Intel i5 4460 to AMD Ryzen 9 5900x. I'm very satisfied with its performance. Main difference after upgrade I noticed that AMD CPU behaves differently temperature wise. While Intel I think got hot over time under heavy load, the AMD one temperatures skyrockets when heavy loaded. Also heard that you cannot just directly compare those two, because they are just so different pieces, and such AMD spikes are normal to certain degree.

Processor is just stock, how it came from box. Plus equipped with NH-D15 cooler.

* Under ""gaming"" loads CPU goes to 80-85 degrees and stays there.
* Under heavy all core loads it goes over 90-95, but also stays there, no throttling. Also very depends with which application you stress test it.
* IDLE temps are around 40-50, with bumps to 60 when opening apps and so on.

Main questions to which I want to find answers:

1. If you have AIR cooler on these top tier models 5900/5950 have you similar situation with temperatures, gets hot fast but still temperature stays flat ?
2. I'm assuming these 80-90 degrees measurements are just result of AIR cooler use, it cannot dissipate hot temperature very fast, but over time manages to keep CPU in temperature range where no thermal limits are applied ? Is this in some way true ?
3. This is normal behavior for these processors where they get hot fast, but in same time if no more load is applied they cool down also fast ?
4. What are your temperatures under heavy load with air coolers ?

\-

 So few things on my mind:

* My CPU chip is hotter than other ones on market.
* Air flow is not good enough due to low case fan speeds.
* Thermal paste got messed up while was mounting cooler.
* All of above ?",False,31,0,1,0

I have been a happy user of a Ryzen 5 2400G since 2 years and boy I love that chip.

The iGPU was a gift considering how well it performed for the price and the fact that it was essentially ""free.""

Rewind to a week back; my games started stuttering and crashing, pretty much randomly; more so confusing, only ""heavy games.""  


Confounded, I ran furmark at max settings at 1080p and the temps were below 60C. Puzzled further, I launched a ""lighter"" game {Brawlhalla} and witnessed so crashes (although I did notice minor stutters)...

So far, nothing made me doubt my iGPU had developed issues; I reinstalled the driver and started playing again.

Games crash randomly; again.  


Reinstall Windows, Install AMD drivers with factory reset checked.

Games freeze now, don't outright crash. At this point I believed my RAM was throwing errors and hence so was VRAM.

Ran memtest86 for an hour, no errors.

&gt;**Overall Cooling**: Pretty good and supervised.

\--------------------------------------------------------------

**Experience:**

I built my PC last year in April. Everything seemed fine and I started playing some games when it would suddenly crash. At the time, I didn't understand much so I thought it was just a driver issue, so I kept ignoring this. The following months it barely crashed, which further reinforced my idea that drivers solved these crashes, but oh boy, the crashes didn't stop after some time. **The crashes were blackscreens followed by a reboot of the system.**

They were really an inconvenient and eventually made me want to rule out any possible defective components. **I changed every single piece of hardware I had and the same issue happened**. In the end, I checked my CPU &amp; RAM with MemTest64 and Prime95, I stressed my GPU with FurMark under supervised thermals, and even with a consumption of \~330W it wouldn't crash. Everything was **rock-solid under SUSTAINED loads**, but NOT when there was a suddent burst, which made me think my GPU wasn't stable at boost clocks, so I pretty much tested every single stable voltage for my clock presets.

I gave up and assumed my GPU was pushed to its very limits from the factory and that the only way to reduce these crashes was to underclock to the ""base"" and ""game"" clock of the 5700XT Reference Card... Hey! It kinda worked, or that's what I thought. Ocasionally it crashed and it really frustrated me.

**These crashes would get worse with VSR turned ON**, which made me realize my VRAM consumption was generally higher and the clocks might also boost higher.

These past days I was somewhat bored and I started testing with unofficial methods to tweak my GPU and I found out **MorePowerTool** and **Red BIOS Editor**, so I was like ""fine, I will stretch the performance to the very limits to rule out whether the clock or the memory is the culprit"".  I managed a very stable 2240 clock speed at 1200 mV, and the advertised maximum boost clock of 2150 at 1100mV, so I noticed something was really off... **I couldn't tweak my memory at all**. I assumed the VRAM modules were ""**good enough**"" and worked as intended at their 1750 MHz speed.

Today, I discovered [This Specific Post](https://mining.help/rx-5700xt-bios-mod/) about VRAM configurations in a mining blog since I could not find any other guide elsewhere. Throughout the guide, there was a comment stating:

&gt; Some cards have **one memory type**, some cards have **two memory types**. Click on the dropdown menu against Memory Type and see if it has one or two types. If it has one, then you are all set, if it has two, select the other one and repeat the above three steps (copy value of 1550Mhz to all the boxes below it). 

I was very puzzled, I checked this section back then and GPU-Z reported my GPU is using Micron memory modules. I assumed I only had to change the memory configuration of the Micron section in Red BIOS Editor. **It turns out my GPU is using both Samsung and Micron memory modules** for some reason and I had to tweak the timings of each memory type in Red BIOS. To my surprise, now **the VRAM had a predictable behaviour** and I could push my memory up to a stable \~1875 MHz with expected artifacting and/or crashes if pushed too much. Also, **the PC crashes due to VRAM were identical to my concurrent random crashes I was having (**blackscreen into reboot).

**My conclusion** is that **many cards come with mixed memory modules** that result in the same **conflict** was someone could have when running RAM modules from different manufacturers due to the quality of their chips and timings. With all this, **I think managed to adjust the VRAM timings to intercompatible values** and the card is now having predictable behaviours and no crashes.",False,153,0,1,0

I just buy a PC with Ryzen 5 Pro 4650G and hoping to use it for daily use + light game since the dedicated GPU is kinda overpriced. Right after I buy, run the pc, and try to open my local video, it seems there are weird lines and dots on the video. I suspect the video got corrupted or etc, but when I open the video on my laptop (shared via one drive) and it seems the video is OK.

I'm trying to uninstall the Display Driver using DDU on windows safe mode, goes back to my normal windows, and boom! The video was able to run normally without any weird stuff inside! but right after I install the Display Driver from my motherboard utilities, it goes the same problem that I had. So, the big possibility this is the driver problem? or what? Please help me.

Note: the problem occurs too on browsers too, but when I disable hardware acceleration, it goes normal and able to run the video really smooth. and here's some example of the problem that i had :

I just happened to look at prices for R9 390s on eBay, and I was surprised to see how high they were. 

I have an R9 390 that I sold a few years ago during the initial mining craze, and the buyer used it for exactly 30 days, at which point he filed a claim with eBay saying it no longer worked. 

Not surprisingly, when I received the card back it worked perfectly, and I ended up using it for another year before upgrading to a 2070 Super. 

So right now, I have an R9 390 collecting dust on the shelf in my office. I would might consider listing it again if these are being purchased by gamers, but if it is due to the etherium mining craze then I'd just as soon keep it, as it's not worth the frustration of having someone ""rent"" it in 30 day increments by exploiting eBay's return policy.",False,30,0,1,0

Those posters didn't update their info.  Does it still work?  Or do Bios updates stop that combo from posting or does something else happen?

Is a B550/3200g not going to work (now/anymore) or too risky since it won't be officially supported?

Currently im still gaming at 1080p but looking to start doing that at 1440p. Dont have any wish to go into 4k gaming anytime soon. 

Also a photographer/videographer that does weddings (large batch exporting) and video rendering at 1080p/4k/and camera also has ability to do 8k. (canon r5) 

Sidenote: Does anyone know if these higher end amd processors can cleanly process 4k/8k files from the R5 or is that still an issue on all modern PC systems do to hardware encoders? (Eg. Mac m1 can process these files even up to 8k perfecly fine with almost no stuttering)

Im not a max level user that I need to min/max my processing time at all costs but I do want something that will last quite a while.

Do I stay with what I have for a while? Upgrade back into intel? Wait for new amd stuff?

Im not in ""dire"" absolute need to upgrade this instant but I have the funds now. Process load is slower at the moment due to covid restrictions but once things open up itll get busier.

Amd,New AMD system underwhelming/unstable performance,"Hey everyone,

I'm hoping that some people here with more experience with AMD systems can help me out and give me some things to look at to improve performance and stability. 

My components:

* CPU: 5800X (running stock speeds)
* CPU cooler: Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo Black
* PSU: Cooler Master V850 SFX (two separate 8-pin cables running from the PSU to GPU)
* RAM: 2x 8 GB - 3200 Mhz, CL16 (XMP enabled)
* GPU: 6900 XT (running stock speeds) (drivers: 21.4.1)
* Motherboard: Gigabyte Aorus X570 I Pro Wifi (Mini ITX) (bios: F33h - newest) (latest chipset drivers installed)
* Monitor: AOC 1080p screen, 144 hz (freesync compatible) 

I've had every single component except for the 6900 XT since December. I've been running an MSI GTX 970 until a couple of weeks ago when I got my 6900 XT from the AMD website. When my system was using the GTX 970, the frames weren't all that good in Warzone and GTA 5 (as expected from a 7 year old card), but at least my system was stable during gaming, no hitching, stuttering and even random reboots. I had the feeling that the GTX 970 was being used properly and being used to its absolute limit. 

Unfortunately since I've put the 6900 XT in my system, I have a feeling that this video card isn't being used properly by games. In Warzone, after a couple of minutes, the game starts to stutter, making it virtually unplayable and it even randomly rebooted yesterday. In GTA 5, although there is no stuttering, the frames drop from 140 to as low as 90 and back again to 140 every couple of seconds. I don't know if this is normal? Maybe it was unrealistic expectations, but I honestly thought that it could keep a stable 140 almost all the time in GTA 5 in 1080p. Using the Radeon software, I noticed that the GPU utilization tends to go from 90% all the way down to as low as 30% in these games within a couple of seconds. Is this normal behavior? Also, the temperature of the 6900 XT is around 50 - 55 degrees Celsius, which seems to be really low I think. The GTX 970 I had was always running around 70+ with the exact same setup. 

When I put the 6900 XT in my system, I immediately wiped all partitions and did a complete reinstall of Windows 10 Pro, 21H1. I've done dozens of these nuke and pave installs in the past. After the installation was done, I let the system run for an hour doing its thing in the background. Afterwards, I installed the chipset drivers and video card drivers. Enabled XMP in the bios. I haven't turned on SAM or done anything else in the bios. I turned off the driver downloads that Windows does in the advanced system settings. The only thing I have on this PC right now is literally Steam, [Battle.net](https://Battle.net), GTA 5 and Warzone.

Are there any settings I can try turning off or on? The random reboot, could it be related to the unstable USB performance with AMD CPUs? I have a bunch of USB devices and a hub hooked up to my PC. 

I also want to say that I do not have problems outside of games. My system doesn't reboot and doesn't stutter in any way outside of gaming.",False,1,0,1,0

CPU: I May overclock a little bit and reduce the voltage to squeeze some MHz out, otherwise not as important (yes i know dark hero is good for it but yeah going high end) so can someone provide some info.

RAM: Here's the major question and I've read situation about it (single rank vs dual rank, T-topology VS Daisy chain)

3. confirmation 3600MHz is the sweet spot now for AMD Ryzen? for FLCK at 1800 so its 1:1 ratio. Is there any reason to overclock it a bit more?
4. Or should i perhaps get a 3200MHz CL16 G.skill and overclock it to 3600MHz? (honestly i prefer just getting the 3600MHz one)

And they seem to back on 21.5.2 but it seems to be worse. In the original post I said timeout issues happen randomly.

This time, it did not happen through games but unexpectedly while watching Netflix. The driver timed out out of nowhere and screen started flickering. Then it went black but stayed that way and I could not do anything, so I forced turned off PC from power button. When it booted, I noticed everything was choppy and laggy and assumed it was normal. I played videos and they seemed to be completely stuttering. So I launched a game and noticed it was running at maximum 30 fps in the menu. I checked my monitor and it was showing as 30 hz which was weird. I opened Windows Display Driver Management and it was showing as Microsoft Basic Display Adapter with Video Ram showing as zero. Then I noticed the Adrenalin Launch icon you can find by right clicking desktop was missing, and Adrenalin was not showing in task manager. This all happendd unexpectedly and it is the first time it has happened with this driver version. The weird part is that Adrenalin just basically died after that, usually when driver timeouts it resets and works properly a few seconds later. I had to DDU and reinstall the whole driver just to get a 144 hz output again.

Weeks ago, I settled on the NH-D15 (non-S), but, given the NH-D15S's price w/ no tax, I've started looking again.

It is _highly_ unlikely I'll overclock, or get anything more demanding/powerful than a 5800X for a while (unless I can get one for a steal).  

I'm not obsessed with having super-low temps. I think I'd be okay with it as long as it's not obviously… ""under-capable"", but I _would_ like an air cooler with: 

* some room to grow (could perhaps handle an OC'd 5800X or stock 5900X)
* good RAM clearance
* good value; defined as a balance between price, performance, and features

Bonus: Comes in Black or White, cuz I'm _somewhat_ going for a B&amp;W build.

I'm trying to decide between (prices in CAD):

* [ARCTIC Freezer 34 Esports Duo - White](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0846LXCJ6/)
* [Noctua NH-D15S chromax.Black](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B08HM1T6RL/) (makes more sense than the non-S right now, given price difference and RAM clearance)
* [Scythe Mugen 5 - Black Edition](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B08X4HX858/) / [Scythe Mugen 5 Rev.B](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B06ZYB8K77/) (really not sure what Rev.B adds. They mention now offering full AM4 compatibility, but the non-Rev.B Mugen 5 mentions AM4 compatibility. Was AM4 compatibility lacking on the non-Rev.B?)

There are really some great insights into the turnaround of AMD and ZEN:

&gt;The funny thing was, we knew we were kind of at the end of the road -  our customers weren’t buying our products, and the stuff on the roadmap  wasn’t any good. I didn’t have to convince people very much about that.  There were a few people who said ‘you don’t understand Jim, we have an  opportunity to make 5%’. **But we were off by 2X, and we couldn’t catch up  \[going down that route\]. So I made this chart that summarised that our  plan was to** ***‘fall a little further behind Intel every year until we  died’*****.**  
&gt;  
&gt;With Zen, we were going to catch up in one generation. There were  three groups of people - a small group believed it (that Zen would catch  Intel in one generation); a medium-sized group of people that thought  if it happens, it would be cool; then another group that definitely  believed it was impossible. A lot of those people laughed, and some of  them kind of soldiered on, despite this belief. There was a lot of  cognitive dissonance, but I found all kinds of people that were really  enthusiastic.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mike Clark was the architect of Zen, and I made this list of things  we wanted to do \[for Zen\]. I said to Mike that if we did this it would  be great, so why don’t we do it? He said that AMD could do it. My  response was to ask why aren't we doing it - he said that everybody else  says it would be impossible. I took care of that part. It wasn’t just  me, there were lots of people involved in Zen, but it was also about  getting people out of the way that were blocking it. It was fun – as  I’ve said before, computer design needs to be fun. I try to get people  jazzed up about what we’re doing. I did all kinds of crazy stuff to get  people out of that kind of desultory hopelessness that they were falling  into. 

The part about his role at Intel was also interesting:

&gt;My team at Intel was 10,000 people, right, so you spend a lot of time  on organization charts and budgets, and all kinds of admin, and then  it's easy to find yourself just doing that and saying you’ll hand off  leadership for a project to this person or this person and that. But the  problem is there's so many things that are cross-functional – I want to  know what the fab is doing, how does the PDK work, how does the library  work, how does the IP team work, how does the SoC integration work, how  does the performance model work, how does the software work. Then you  find out that if you can't deep dive into all those pieces, bad things  happen.

I dunno what happened in the past week but all cheap amd epyc 7501 stocks on ebay are all gone (in the 800CDN range)

But I did find a couple of cheap 7601 but they are locked to dell motherboards only? Where can I find these dell servers?

Thank you very much everyone as I am in desperate need of a cheap amd server.

Amd,6800XT Lower performance than a 1660TI?," Hi, so I ""upgraded"" from a 1660TI to an 6800XT and oh boy, am I the only person that suddenly run into a hella lot issues? I can't play outriders anymore and some of the games I'm trying to play the performance is even worse than on my 1660TI in fact, some of the game even don't render animations anymore, idk what to do I'm at a loss, anybody's got any experience with it and know a possible solution?

I've already tried the 21.4.2 Driver but that one seems to have issues for me in some of the games I play, so I'm back to the latest 21.5.2 Drivers.

Note: I don't play mainstream games such as Fortnite, Valorant, Overwatch, Apex and other Garbage I player Games like Phantasy Star Online 2, Revelation Online, FFXIV and other MMO's but the 6800XT just performs quite poorly in some of them.

**W21 is in relation to the workweek, these updates were released between May 24th – May 27th**

&amp;#x200B;

***Why is my motherboard not listed?***

It may have been recently updated. Check https://www.asus.com/us/support/ to see if it has been. I post updates on a weekly basis. UEFI’s are released in waves, because of this it can take an entire series weeks or months to see the “same” update if it includes items like CPU firmware. Furthermore, keep in mind that not all updates are applicable to all models. Due to inherent design differences as well as specification and feature variation an update may only be applicable to a specific model.

***How can I be notified about UEFI updates when they are released?***

If you want to be kept in the loop, you can also follow me for notifications when updates are released/posted. I am also the admin for our PCDIY Facebook Group where I post updates and other ASUS centric product news https://www.facebook.com/groups/ASUSPCDIY

***How long after a board is produced will UEFI updates be released?***

Keep in mind that generally after a year a motherboard reaches a certain maturity level and as such will see fewer updates. If you feel you have an issue that is dependent on a UEFI release, please submit a support ticket. In some cases, some boards can see updates for more than 24 months+

***I want to update but am not sure how to update the UEFI ""BIOS""?***

If you want guidance on how to flash/update your UEFI BIOS please watch the video linked below.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scK8AP8ZACc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scK8AP8ZACc)

***Should I update the UEFI if my system is stable and running without issue?***

If your system is running without issue, especially if overclocked in any way ( including DRAM ) it is advised you stay on the build/release you are on. Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can change the OC experience and require you to retune a previously stable OC value. This does not mean the UEFI is not a functioning release but that changes in the underlying code base need to be accounted for when tuning a system. As many of these values are in low level or specific operating parameters it is best to retune from full UEFI defaults after you have re-run stability test at UEFI defaults.

***What if the UEFI BIOS listed is a BETA? Should I update?***

BETA UEFI releases are for enthusiasts who want access to the latest features, functions, and microcode enhancements, and overall UEFI improvements. As they are not officially supported, they are not recommended for day-to-day / long-term use. Users who plan to use their system in this capacity and want to ensure the best interoperability/compatibility and stability, as well as performance, should wait for a formal release.  
 

***How long does it take for a formal release to be issued (between BETA and formal)?***

  
The time span between a BETA and formal release can vary depending on multiple factors including new internal code being provided, validation and qualification as well as other important aspects of UEFI development and validation. Generally, you will see a formal release within 1 to 3 months. In some cases, BETAs are singular releases and will not see a formal release.

***Will a UEFI ""BIOS"" update improve the performance of my system?***

A UEFI update can include CPU microcode as well as other performance tuning enhancements that can influence/increase performance. With this noted it is generally minimal. As always performance analysis/comparisons should be done at stock-to-stock values. This means loading F5 on both releases and comparing your application/benchmark scores. OC-related comparisons may require retuning prior to testing as changes to underlying auto rules can invalidate prior scores even if with similar settings.

***Not every user should update/flash their UEFI BIOS. I stress this again, if you are running without issue(s) you are advised to stay on the release you are running.*** 

***Notes to consider -***

***\* When flashing please perform the update process at full UEFI defaults. Do NOT flash with an overclocked system/profile.***

1.I recommend updating the UEFI BIOS on your motherboard for new PC builds. This helps to ensure the best interoperability, compatibility, and performance. If you are building a PC and have not yet installed the OS, I would recommend you update the UEFI.

2.Keep in mind flashing/updating the UEFI will reset all defined parameters/settings and operating profiles. You will not be able to restore defined values by using a UEFI Profile as profiles are not interoperable between builds. It is advised you note or screenshot (F12) your values prior to flashing if they are complex. Upon completing a flash, I would recommend you load UEFI defaults after the fact and complete a full reboot and shutdown prior to re-entering your prior values. Keep in mind you may need to retune these values under a new UEFI.

3.When you update the UEFI and re-load UEFI defaults depending on your originally defined CSM/UEFI device parameters you may experience BOOT issues. Depending on prior settings you may need to enable or disable CSM to restore BOOT functionality.

4.Be advised that in some cases a rollback to a prior UEFI is not possible. This generally is the case when there is an update that includes CPU microcode (such as an AMD AEGSA or Intel ME). This means you may not be able to “flashback” to a prior release.

5.While not always necessary some UEFI updates may require a clearing of the CMOS. You can either clear the CMOS via the CLR CMOS button if your motherboard has this feature/function or you can also CLR CMOS by removing the onboard CMOS battery for at least a few minutes. You can also attempt to locate the CLR CMOS jumper on the motherboard and short the pins.

6.In some cases, you may not be able to jump from an older UEFI release to a much newer release. You may need to ""step"" update, this will mean upgrading incrementally to a slightly newer build first prior to going to the most recent build/release. In most situations this not required.

I also recommend you backup your system prior to any flash/update and always advise flash/update become executed from a fresh loading (F5) of UEFI defaults.

The board model/name is on the right-hand side and the version number is on the left-hand side. To download the UEFI BIOS please go to https://www.asus.com/support/

Amd,Gigabyte 5700 XT always 85 degrees and TJ of 110+ on stock settings,"Hello everyone,

I bought the Gigabyte Radeon RX 5700 XT Gaming OC 8GB and while it it performs really well, there is one thing I never understood.

I searched around and found some statements that this card is supposed to run hot and junction temperatures of 110 are within spec, but is that true? 

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/U4TRa4q) is an example of what happens when I play The Evil Within on full resolution (2560x1440) for instance. It's an old game so I thought maxing the settings couldn't hurt.

Regardless of the game, both temperatures always seem to max out. If I play the same game but on stock settings, I even seen the GPU hit 111 degrees which is worrying.

I'm currently using these Radeon settings:

Frequency: 1906
Voltage: 1095
Max fan speed 60%
Power limit 50%
VRAM 1748Mhz

My PC case is a [CoolerMaster H500M](https://www.coolermaster.com/catalog/cases/mid-tower/mastercase-h500m/) and leaves ample space for the hot air to escape.

My CPU is equiped with a [Noctua NHU12A cooler](https://noctua.at/en/nh-u12a)

The room temperature ios around 23 degrees on average with my balcony door open almost the whole day as I work from home.


Sorry for the long wrtie-up but I'm really keen on finding out what is causing these high temperatures. The card is only a year old and I did everything according to the book to reduce it.

Any helps or insights is greatly appreciated.",False,22,0,1,0

So I bought a second hand card a while ago. The first owner was using a waterblock and I think he might have misplaced the thermal pads when he assembled the stock cooler on. I was looking for video or photo where I can see the correct places for thermal pads, but I was not lucky. 

So here I am asking if you guys have a schematic or something?

I've also read that cooling pads may damage your laptop because they blow dust into it as well as making your laptop's fans spin faster.

As for the dust, if you place your cooling pad and your laptop on a clean surface free of dust, then there shouldn't be any problem right ? My only concern is with cooling pads making laptop's fans spin faster, is it true ? If so, does it really damage the fans in the long run ?

240GB SSD
I know this isn’t some extreme power build. But it is my first build since switching over from an AlienWare laptop. My computer does everything and plays everything I’ve wanted to. It was my budget build right before the pandemic. Yes I’d love to get something more powerful and modern but with prices right now I’d like to hold out for some time. Back then I just got an inexpensive monitor because the price was very good and seemed like it could do what I needed (Acer Nitro 21.5” 1920x1080 75Hz IPS specifically VG220Q bmiix model). But I’d like to upgrade. So I’m asking what would be the best monitor I could get or just spec wise to get the most out of my system with a budget of about $400 tops. Most I’ve been looking at are more around the low $300 range if not less. So 1080p and higher refresh? 1440p? As I said before I’d like to upgrade later on, more likely just a whole new build. Something along the lines of 3060 and up if not a 2080 or equivalent. So would a 1440p 144Hz be too much and not play well? Asking so if that would be better to buy a higher quality monitor for more powerful setup later on. Apologies as this stuff is still somewhat new to me. I don’t hold any particular loyalty to any brand or size. Maybe something with Freesync if I’m able to? Flat or curved monitors? (I’m guessing not in the 24”-27” due to different panels). Thank you.

Amd,5900x on MSI B450 Gaming Plus Max + Budget Cooler 👍 Compatible,"Making this post for anyone this may help.

I updated the bios to the most recent one, but it wasn't a simple plug-and-play installation. The PC booted up like normal, though it had noticeable stutters just browsing or opening startup programs -- it actually felt a lil worse than the 1700x I upgraded from.

[For cooling, I use a stock heatsink+fan that came with my dell inspiron 5675 prebuilt. That pc died after 2 years but I kept the cpu, ram &amp; cooler for my current custom build.]

I opened up task manager &amp; hwmonitor. The 5900x was boosting well above stock, reaching 4.6 to 4.8 in random bursts during idle. Temps spiked also, forcing my fans to run loudly at full speed. Seeing the high boost number was cool but it just felt wrong since I wasn't doing anything intensive -- cpu usage was between 4% to 16%. The sound levels were too high to run that as a daily thing.

My pc also reboot or crashed several times before I went back into the bios to change something. 

What worked for me: 

- turning off PBO completely
- changing my fan curve to max out at lower %
- changed voltage from auto (1.46) to override (1.28)
- changing cpu ratio from auto to 37 -&gt; 3.7ghz 
- ram to XMP profile 2, even though profile 1 has the same exact thing -- 3200mhz same timings

Went into cinebench r23 &amp; my 5900x performs around 18.5k multicore, which seems below average. Still hella fast in comparison to my old 1700x's score of 8.8k. But hopefully that will change when I upgrade to an AIO. Idc to overclock but don't want my cpu to underperform at stock either.

So in essence, yes the 5900x can be bios updated to be compatible with a msi b450 gaming plus max. Yes, a stock dell cooler heatsink+fan can handle the base 3.7ghz, even when gaming &amp; streaming Apex Legends for 6+ hours. Gaming FPS was a lil lower than I expected but still the best I've ever had (ranging from 130fps to 300 max). My cpu &amp; case fans still run a lil louder than I'd like but still finding the right settings til I get an AIO (hoping Gigabyte releases their new Aorus Waterforce X 240 in the US to match my new Aorus 6800xt gpu.

Amd,First time curve optimizer for gaming - 5800x,"Hello fellow red teammates

&amp;#x200B;

First time i went to a full AMD build with 5800x and rx 6800XT, and with it i had a hard time learning all the different stuff amd has when it comes to CPU tweaking

I only use the PC for hardcore gaming, mostly warzone, and while performance wise im getting very good results.

My cpu sits arround 65C max temps and pushing clocks at 4.5-4.6 ghz.

After so much reading about curve optimizer and undervolting, from my understanding i might be able to get the same or even better performance setting PBO with a negative offset in curve optimizer, while using less voltage on the CPU, and so, lower temps, which might increase the CPU's lifespam.

&amp;#x200B;

Since it will be my first time messing arround with this kind of settings i was hopping you guys could give me some advices on the best settings for it and if this video is a good guide for it [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfkrp25dpQ0&amp;t=168s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfkrp25dpQ0&amp;t=168s)

What if I don't use XMP but manually enter lower CAS latencies with a faster RAM running at the supported frequency, does that void the warranty of the CPU ?

What is the likelihood of XMP or RAM overclocking somehow damaging the CPU ?

I see that dual channel boosts the performance a lot but RAM speed and latency also make a big difference, I consider adding more RAM in the future so single stick of faster RAM will be more advantageous later but I'm not entirely sure about choosing faster single channel vs dual channel...

FYI i don't know much about benchmark scores is this a good value??

Amd,The case for why AMD should released multiplier locked Ryzen processors.,"Before you lecture me on how only greedy Intel is charging you for the multiplier locked ""premium"", let me show you that AMD is charging you this premium right now.

Ryzen 7 5800X is more expensive than Core i7-11700K.

Ryzen 5 5600X is more expensive than Core i5-11600K.

You may ask, what about AMD's cheaper offerings such as the the Ryzen 5 3600?

Ryzen 5 3600 is more expensive and slower than Core i5-10400.

Even with an overclock, Ryzen 5 3600 isn't going to overtake the Core i5-10400.

So, in other words, AMD is charging you the ""premium"" right now.

This leads to my next point:

AMD should released multiplier locked processors such as a multiplier locked Ryzen 5 5400, which would be a worthy competitor to the Core i5-11400 (when supply allows, of course).",False,50,0,1,0

Amd,Should I give up my 5950x and go back to Intel?,"Honestly, it's got to a point where I'm contemplating giving up my Ryzen 5950x and going back to Intel.

Speaking with folks over here who have the 5950x, they're all getting wonderful idle temps of 33C, and 60C while gaming. Meanwhile, I'm looking at 67-71C at idle and 86C when gaming.
Not doing anything fancy either, just running stock with a XMP Profile enabled. Super basic things. Have my BIOS at the latest version for my motherboard, MSI X570 Creation Prestige.

I figured maybe it was my coolers failing to properly cool my 5950x chip. I tried two AIO coolers thus far, the NZXT Kraken z73 and Corsair iCUE H150i Elite CAPELLIX. Tried the Kraken z73 first with its stock thermal paste, then I took it off and applied Noctua NT-H2 paste. After that, I bought the H150i and tried that (used the stock paste), and still no change in my temps.

I've basically had to rely on editing my power plan, and lowering the maximum processor state from 100% to 95% (which limits my clockspeed to 3.16 GHz), and then I see 44C at idle, which is still nowhere close to what everyone else is getting when at 100% power.

Are there some magic settings in the BIOS I'm missing to make my 5950x act 'normal'?

Also, I do a lot of video editing on the system for work on a weekly basis, and recently while rendering a 1080p video, the temps hit max 86 degrees (the highest I've seen so far, earlier they wouldn't cross 80 while rendering).

Now is this a cause for concern? The limit for the CPU is 95 degrees, but I want to optimize the system and get the most performance out of it, while not pushing it. And I have read that idle temps for CPU when idle should be between 30 to 40 degrees (mine are way over that).

Then i can play all day without issue. This new DELL monitor is certified for FreeSync Premium Pro with HDR400.

First it was RE Village with driver 21.4.1 and 21.5.1. Then it was Doom Eternal on 21.5.1 and 21.5.2, now it's Remnant from the Ashes on 21.5.2 from GamePass. Previous games were on Steam. Today it rebooted again, playing Horizon Zero Dawn first time in this game after 15 hours of gameplay.

Is this a feature of the FreeSync Premium Pro specification or can HDR cause these issues? I'm running my monitor on 120Hz and btw. i have noticed at 60Hz big power draw around 30 watts.

I just want to drop my 6700XT from like 230W to 180W (or so) by purely undervolting and reducing max clocks by 200 MHz (or thereabouts). The objective is to reduce heat output as much as possible, while retaining about 90% of the factory indended performance of the card. I have a small case and the chipset fan is right below the card, so it starts screaming like mad after only a couple minutes of full GPU load, so lower temps are desired.

So, with the above witten in mind...

1) Do I need to use MorePower tool to drop the voltage cieling and then try to drag down the voltage curve via offset in Wattman?

2) Do I modify max core clock in Wattman or MPT?

3) Do I need to max out the power slider to +15% in Wattman, if I'm only trying to slightly downclock and reduce voltage, and thus power cosumption in tandem?

3) Do i need to edit (lower) the GPU power limit in MorePowerTool too? (Igor's guide also suggests to modify/lower ""TCD limit GFX"" also?)

The only thing I do know how to set are the fan settings in MorePowerTool (in my experience, works better than in Wattman). I did boost the fans speed by a few hundred RPM this way and it works flawlessly.

Amd,5800X running suspiciously cool,"Hello,

I bit the bullet and upgraded my Ryzen 5 1400 with a new 7 5800X. Paired it up with a NH-D15S and added an extra cooler to it since I had one lying around and Noctua was kind enough to send an extra racket thingys, and I've heard rumours that the new Ryzens have a habit of running hot. The old 1400 was non-OC on a stock cooler (that turned out to have so much dust built up it might as well could have been passive) pushing 81c while hashing monero at around 2kH/s.

On non-OC the 5800x couldnt even break 70c hashing the same coin at 8kH/s, and after CTR2.1 doing its thing it barely pushes past 60c even though the hashes went up to 10kH/s, let alone wattage that doesn't go over 120W at a constant 4.6GHz. Now I know the nature of CTR is to do exactly that but I wasn't expecting the CPU to run that cool on 100% load, even with the undervolt.

The question is more of a mindset thing, should I be happy that I probably won a silicon lottery and can run this thing this fast and cool, or should I maybe try to push it further with some more unforgiving settings on the CTR? What would you do?

I'm looking to upgrade from an ""old"" MSI gaming laptop from early 2017 with 64gb of RAM/rtx 1080 to a kickass workstation with ideally a 5950x AND 256gb of ram. Plus at least enough m2 ports. And ideally 4 x pci 16

I have another machine with a 10900 and 128gb of RAM. The more memory for what I do is better. I've long passed 64gb of memory in active work.

In a 3950x world a motherboard like the [GIGABYTE TRX40 AORUS Xtreme](https://www.amazon.com/GIGABYTE-TRX40-AORUS-Fins-Array-Motherboard/dp/B081JDP378/ref=pd_di_sccai_5/142-6045616-0909042) seems close to perfect.

I typically build new machines every 3 to 5 years and max them out.

However I'm surprised to see that I can't find any motherboard that looks anywhere as good in a 5950x series world. Ideally 512gb or 256gb of ram. I can't seem to find.

Issue: exceptionally high junction temp when running unlimited frames on a custom loop.

What I've found is that junction temp doesn't just measure the junctions in the GPU die. It also messures the hottest VRM! As it turns out the thermal pads on my vrms weren't contacting the waterblock by about a mm, this was causing near instant junction temps to hit 110 abd shutdown. I took it apparent abd had to scavange for some pads (from the vrm cooling of an old aaus motherboard) installed and now it's MUCH better. Before I was getting unstable runs with furmark and instant 110c, now after 6 mins I'm reaching an (idle fan) equilibrium of 68 on the GPU and 95 on the junction hotspot!

1. 3D stacking definitely on the roadmap
2. Different technologies along the price curve
3. Highest performance technology can afford different elements but cost sensitive products would be less complex
4. 2.5D and 3D packaging key element to unlock next level of performance


&gt;**Lisa Su**

&gt;Absolutely, Harlan. Look, we've been sort of a leader in this idea of sort of advanced packaging and how do you use silicon for its best performance and feature set. Really, this is the key aspect of innovation. When you think about sort of all that's said about Moore's Law slowing, it means that you're getting performance gains by going to smaller geometries, but not necessarily the same gains that you got a few years ago.

&gt;We were very early in sort of the idea of using 2.5D packaging with high bandwidth memory together with our GPUs, as well as using a chiplet architecture to really get the incredible performance that we're seeing with each generation of EPYC. You'll see us continue to innovate on that roadmap.

&gt;3D chip stacking is definitely on the roadmap. We see it as another tool in the tool chest, as you think about how do you put these different pieces together. I think what you will also see is you might see different technologies used along the price curve. You can imagine the highest performance technologies can afford different elements, and then as you get into more cost sensitive, you might not be able to use all that complexity. Think about it as AMD will push the envelope on 2.5D and 3D packaging as we go forward because it's a key element to unlock that next level of performance. Again, we'll talk a little bit more about that as we go through the next number of months as we roll out the next phase of our of our roadmaps.",False,90,0,1,0

Amd,APU architecture (memory map vs pcie),"Hi beautifull people, first post here but nothing special (pretty excited!!).

I was looking a bit deeper in the Apple M1 architecture and a question instantly popped in my head. Why does AMD use a PCIe connection to interface from CPU to GPU in there APUs?

I aknowledge the fact that the GPUs used are ""loosely"" based on desktop counterparts but it still makes no sense for me.

Let's look at the facts:  
1. The GPU already uses a chunk of the systems memory (already mapped in a way)  
2. Although there's a pcie controller/interface ready to use from standard desktop designs it's just a medium for ""converting"" instructions which could pretty easily get bypasssed, skipped or redisigned.  
3. Memory mapped io usually is faster in both bandwidth and latency, simpler and less expensive  
4. Having a separate IO chip and chiplets is more flexible and allows for such designs  
5. I believe there's already some memory map/bus/ports functionality in most CPUs, even modern ones  
6. and most importanty... it would allow to still have THE FULL 20 pcie lanes for general use AND a gpu.

I'm not an AMD engineer and as such I can't know what the reasoning is for this but I'd be surprised if memory mapping wasn't at least a consideration dusring the design phase. What's your opinions on the matter?",False,22,0,1,0

&amp;#x200B;

Just to clarify, my motherboard is an Aorus B550M Pro, and I want the second ssd to store my games, be it a 2Tb NVME or a 2tb Sata SSD, they cost practically the same, but with the big difference in speeds of read / write (3000Mb vs 500Mb approx) (both being faster than hdd)

Which one would you choose and why?

Would the usb and sata ports be disabled with 2 nvme?  


Thanks in advance for any help.

I do game on the same machine, currently on a GTX 1060 1080p 144hz. Planning to upgrade to a 3070/3080 later and a 1440p monitor.

Do the two extra cores provide any noticeable advantage for work (as described) and daily usage? If they do, I figure that later at 1440p the bottleneck won't be significant, and might as well go with the 3800xt to gain in daily usage comfort.

While I was at it, I swapped out my Arctic Liquid Freezer II 420 mounting brackets with the updated brackets that support offset mounting on my motherboard. I also used Arctic MX-5 thermal compound instead of MX-4. I'm seeing slightly over 40% improvement in Cinebench R23 scores; this makes me happy. 😊 

I was hesitant to upgrade for a few reasons:

* I had major USB and integrated audio issues up until AMD released AGESA 1.2.0.1 Patch A. This AGESA update resolved all my USB and audio issues on my 3900X. I am hoping I do not run into new USB/audio issues with the 5950X (I don't expect I will).
* I've read enough stories about poor shopping experiences with AMD. I ordered the CPU on AMD's online store. First, the product was available. Second, the ordering process went smoothly. Finally, I received the CPU crazy fast (\~44 hours from ordering to my door) and with no physical damage.
* I always hate pulling CPU coolers off, with fear of damaging pins on the old CPU or the socket itself if the cooler doesn't come off nicely. Fortunately, my CPU cooler cooperated and came off nicely. The cleanup with easy, too.
* Finally, I've seen plenty of posts about DOA chips or chips that produce WHEA errors, etc. I'm sure this is a tiny percentage of chips. My CPU seems to be working well, and standard XMP settings (just 3600) are running great.

I'm looking for some help for the cooling of my computer because I run it a ""weird way"".

I own an arcade cab at home (a Vewlix) that I have been upgrading with a computer, 1440p screen etc. Now, I run a Radeon 6800 and a 5600x inside of it which gives me wonderful performances, but I'm a little bit affraid of heat.

&amp;#x200B;

[I haven't got any other picture at the moment, and will not be at home for a couple of days. \^\^](https://preview.redd.it/bn80qfpkfv071.png?width=3522&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98f668e92189b4bec1db41199978f3220e2b3f76)

The issue is ""the shape"" of the cab. Vewlix only have 2 ventilations (one in the back of the screen and one and one in the bottom), and the computer is mounted on a wood plate.

&amp;#x200B;

[Here's a little drawing that I did for a friend of mine couple of months ago, maybe it will be easier for the explanation, sorry if it's written in french...](https://preview.redd.it/47w6cdo3ev071.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4621f6413fe4124c776d3404e0bdc0323994fb38)

My main issue is, that when my computer gets hot, all the heat stays on the top of the cab, and goes really slow to be ejected. For the moment, I haven't got any issue, but in my opinion, if I could keep my motherboard cold, it would avoid a lot of problems and stress.

&amp;#x200B;

SOOOO, my question is : What is in your opinion the best way to cool all my stuff? Without having to make holes in the cab, even if it could be a solution if I don't find any other way to do it properly...

&amp;#x200B;

My main solution now would be to upgrade to a Noctua NH D15s, Corsair A500 or BeQuiet Dark Rock Pro 4 and see how it runs.

The thing is that I'm not able to see good comparatives of them. People are always talking about the noise, running them at 1000rpm,...

Cue friday, I bought a 5950X and a Gigabyte Aorus X570 Pro, rebuilt the system (carried over everything from the Intel rig except the CPU and mainboard, even the Noctua NH-D15), even the same install of Windows.

Ram worked at 3466Mhz CL16, which is the rated spec XMP/AMP SPD setting. Machine set my face on fire. 
decided to futz about a bit, ram was fine at 3600CL16.. ran that for most of Saturday and into Sunday morning.

My flesh was a bit singed at this point.

And right now, with apparent stability (obviously it's early days, soak testing is needed), that ram is doing 3733Mhz CL16, Infinity Fabric is 1:1 and this thing hauls more ass than I could possibly imagine. [(Geekbench- comparison baseline is with the ram at 3600CL16)](https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/compare/8045352?baseline=8038234)

There is but one issue, which is that there were no new shiny graphics cards available basically anywhere, so I'm using a GTX1080 still, not a bad card by any means, that's still entirely respectable. But I'm discovering new territories of what it means to be GPU limited, behold [Ghost Recon Wildlands](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sgi65ag0vrdk9ic/Tom%20Clancy%27s%20Ghost%20Recon%20%20Wildlands%20Screenshot%202021.05.23%20-%2012.05.33.69.png?dl=0)

Well the settings it chose are a bit...crazy. Obviously the CPU will never actually reach those values but I'm curious if it's better to leave them as is or I should go back to Manual.

Amd,AMD's driver issues with alot of cards and what can be done to help,"I used a Sapphire Pulse RX 5600 XT and was forced to switch back to my old r9 290 due to alot of driver issues. From what I could gather on the AMD Help Subreddit (r/AMDHelp/) there are quite a few issues with the newer GPU's and some older ones. These series are the ones I see the most for black screen crashes, driver timeouts and green screen crashes.

* RX 500 series
* RX 5000 series
* RX 6000 series

Considering the amount of posts on AMD Help about this stuff I am wondering if these can be traced back to faulty hardware or faulty software. Rolling back to previous more stable versions seem to help alot, so this must be a software issue. 

These issues persisted for quite a while now and I personally would love to play newer games again, but the current GPU market also forces alot of people, like myself, to stick with bad drivers rather than RMA the card or get a better one, perhaps even from the competition. 

I have always been an AMD user and would love to continue, but these past months have been somewhat annoying and difficult to handle, especially with the time I had to put into troubleshooting. 

With this post I try to raise a little more awareness to the issues and perhaps put a bit more pressure on AMD to fix their driver issues.

I haven't opened anything. After doing more research, now I'm thinking I should not go with the 3200G with the integrated graphics, get a CPU that's a little more expensive with 6 or 8 cores and just overpay for an older perhaps used GPU. I've seen GPUs that aren't powerful by current standards, but are capable of performing better than the 3200G for prices in the $150 range. So my thinking is, if I pay $75 or so more for a CPU with 6 -8 cores then find a cheap graphics card I'd have a rig that may perform a little better than the 3200G, but it would be muck easier to upgrade. I could just buy a more powerful GPU when the market levels out. Seems like using the 3200G with no GPU I'm building a rig for $550 - $600 that is on or behind par with a PS4 which I could find used for $250 with some looking around. With the build I have now, wouldn't I need to replace the 3200G when I got a graphics card? If I could just add a GPU without needing to upgrade the 3200G, then this build is cool. I assumed the 3200G wouldn't suffice because a lot of its processing power is sacrificed for the integrated graphics. Forgive my ignorance, again, I've just jumped into the world of PC gaming. So what do you all think I should do? I'd love to think it'd be okay to just add a GPU to this 3200G build I have now because I'm dying to begin my first build, especially since it's all sitting right here in my room.  But I'd rather go the other route if that's what makes the most sense. I'd love your opinions on what I should do.",False,6,0,1,0

The only difference between these two cpu that I found is that 4700GE has unlocked multiplier (for overclocking whatever I guess) and other doesn't.

Is it possible to boost the igpu performance with this specific machine by overclocking or is it just pointless?  Especially with the stock cooler.

Am not much of a overclocking guy but like to try a bit to boost the igpu performance a little.

4750GE costs 50 AUD more but the benchmarks seems identical so am not sure if its worth the extra cost and the locked CPU. If there are any specific benefits to this CPU then please let me know.

I'm fortunate enough to have picked up a new console and new card, so for fun I'll compare some games. 6700xt is paired with a Ryzen 5 3600x. Most games I set a limit to 120fps to prevent drops because I'm having issues with freesync on my Odyssey G7. 

Star Wars Battlefront II, I slept on this game and it's actually a lot fun. With the new FPS boost on Xbox, it seems to run at 1080p120fps. Definitely a drop in clarity, I enjoyed 4K60fps better on the big screen. 

The 6700xt build ran the game at 1440p 120fps max settings no problem. Plus you get adjustable FOV and other settings.

Battlefield V, same results. Way more to tinker with on PC, so I got 1440p solid 120fps maxed out. Turns out I really suck at this game though. 

Rocket Leauge is interesting. On Xbox, it runs at a resolution between 1440p and 4K at 120fps. So the game looks great and runs great. On PC, I got 1440p and a whopping 240fps. Enough said. 

Apex Legends is 1440p 60fps on Xbox. I'm geussing this is because there's no optimization for new consoles, but still a bit dissapointing. On PC, 1440p and 120fps pretty steady.

Amd,2700x to 5800x for Warzone 1080p 144+fps (speculative upgrade thoughts),"Hello All,

I just wanted to get your thoughts on a speculative upgrade I thought about which could grant me the 140 to 160 fps I want to play this game.

Currently my mini build is a x470i Asus motherboard, 2700x (PBO on at 4.1ghz across board when playing Cod), 16gb 3400hz cl 16 16 memory, and an overclocked 1070ti (+750 memory +140 core - which is getting close to a 2060 super. 

As of present I am getting between 90 to 120 fps in warzone games (depends on map area but my average would be around 105 fps) , at 1440p with 85% render scale on all low settings except medium textures. 

At 85% render my gpu is working fully ( hovers between 95 to 99% usage) most of the times.

I want to increase my fps to get between 140 to 160 as I have an 165hz 1440p screen and I really don't care about the graphics. 

 If I reduce the render scale down to 75% which would be equal to 1080p scaling, there is no increase in the fps which tells me the cpu is bottleneck ing and the gpu usage drops to 70-80%.

So my conclusion is that if I would upgrade my 2700x to a 5900x that would give me a significant upgrade in frames at 1080p render scale up to the point where my gpu would bottleneck. 

Thing is, I don't know how many fps this move would grant me to try it. I believe my current overclocked gpu would be able to grant 140 to 160 fps at 1080p with a 5900x in hand based on benchmarks I have seen. Any thoughts?

*edit 1: buying a gpu wouldn't be a reasonable option now now due to market prices and also having seen benchmark videos where 2700x pair with rtx 3 series still bottlenecks at around 110fps due to cpu bottleneck. 

TLDR; will upgrading from a 2700x to 5900x together with an overclocked 1070ti  increase my fps at 1080p low from 110 to 140-150?

Thank you.

Amd,Sapphire's new Special Edition Nitro+ 6900XT cards are actually air-cooled Toxic PCBs.,"Pictures [here](https://imgur.com/a/UcygzrZ).

I managed to get my hands on one of these units, and promptly set about taking it apart to get a look at the PCB itself and check for potential waterblock compatibility. My hopes weren't exactly high, as the pictures on Sapphire's website made it pretty obvious that the PCB was at least somewhat different than the other Nitro+ cards. However, I wasn't expecting to find an exact match to the Toxic PCB (picture from IgorsLab review [here](https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PCB-Front-1-scaled.jpg)).

In my opinion, this gives an interesting look at how an AIB might handle branding and market segmentation. As a consequence of the new XTXH version of the 6900XT chip making its way into the new version of the Toxic ""Ultimate Edition"", I wonder if Sapphire will cease making XTX ""Limited Edition"" versions of the Toxic card. They may be replacing it with this new Nitro+ option that it appears is inheriting these XTX chips and their PCBs. The choice to brand these as Nitro+ indicates to me that Sapphire is very concerned about keeping the Toxic label associated with absolute top-tier performance, even if that means having wacky chimera products like the Nitro+ SE to fill product line gaps.",False,29,0,1,0

Amd,Users should be able to run any software they want. That includes mining software.,"I can't believe some people applaud Nvidia for their efforts in limiting mining on their GPUs. It's ridiculous that a company decides what software you can or cannot use on YOUR hardware.

Imagine: you finally get a new shiny 5950X or 6900XT and you want to edit some porn you recorded. Nope, not allowed. Computer says no. Because British government said no. Want to run some scientific calculations? Nope, you need to get the pro version of the GPU. Want to play a violent game? Nope, not allowed in your country. Mining? Nvidia says no.

Slowing down or preventing certain software from running altogether is pure censorship. We do not want to go down this rabbithole.

Thank god AMD doesn't dictate what software we can and cannot use on our GPUs, or even worse, our CPUs. Can you imagine? Just like freedom of speech there should be freedom of software.

It's not relevant if you think proof-of-work cryptocurrencies are a waste of energy, if you think cryptocurrencies are a scam, if you're mad that there's a chip shortage.

Amd,5600x locked at 4 ghz with PBO and auto OC?,"Just upgraded my build with a new cpu and mobo and my cpu speeds weren't as fast as advertised when overclocked.

Amd,Inifinity Cache speculation (input would be appreciated),"In a discussion elsewhere someone asked if Rembrandt might have Infinity Cache. After some thinking I decided that the answer will be 'yes'. However, I'm a software developer, not an ASIC designer, so my guesses may be wide off the mark. I figured that I'd post them here because I know that there are people here who are more knowledgeable than me on the subject.

Also, if anyone has any link to articles or patents which clarify the nature of Infinity Cache, then please post them. A google search about AMD cache brings up either the chiplet cache patent or the ""Shared L1 Caches"" one.

**The nature of Infinity Cache**

The one thing which to me is unique about Infinity Cache is its layout. I'm used to seeing rectangular caches, at a central position. Here we have a cache that's layed out as long strips, with some bumps, on the outside of the die.

My guess about why this is possible is that GPUs are less sensitive to latency, so the physical location of the data matters less. It's possible that this also affects what kind of bus can be used. Perhaps Infinity Cache is called so because it's connected via Infinity Fabric.

My other guess is about the benefit: the ability to use areas of the chip which would normally have no transistors, only routing. As I understand it, a chip's floorplan is made from a few large blocks which are stuffed together on a die, and since they don't always fit perfectly together, there's some space left. If there's a block that doesn't have to have a particular shape, it could be used to fill those spaces.

I understand that a cache would also affect power density, and general power usage, but perhaps the use or layout of this cache helps in that, or the reduction in RAM access more than compensates for it, in the case of a GPU.

**Application to Rembrandt**

If the above assumptions are correct (which is the big question), then I assume that APUs have spaces that aren't used and could be filled with a GPU-specific L3 cache.

One possible reason not to do it would be higher power use, but I assume that: (a) this cache will be smaller than the 16MB L3 CPU cache, so will take relatively little power; (b) the 6nm process will help; (c) even if it leads to higher power consumption, that's only an issue for heavy GPU processing, and when budgeting for power could still be made beneficial when the GPU is used.

So my conclusion was that it's likely for Rembrandt to have some Infinity Cache, even if it's a rather small amount, like 4MB, because it has little cost and some performance benefit.

Amd,Crashing after monitor upgrade,"Until now i was propably lucky bastard, running my reference RX 5700 XT without any issues for 1.5 year while others were filling Reddit with complains..

I had ordinary office 1080p monitor from DELL, 60Hz, nothing fancy. Two weeks ago i have purchased a ""gaming"" monitor DELL S2721DGF and since then i'm experiencing issues. This new monitor is certified for FreeSync Premium Pro with HDR400 certification.

First it was RE Village with driver 21.4.1 and 21.5.1. Then it was Doom Eternal on 21.5.1 and 21.5.2, now it's Remnant from the Ashes on 21.5.2 from GamePass. Previous games were on Steam.

Symptoms are simple, really = Instant computer reboot. I happens randomly in all games. After 10 min or after one hour. Then i can play 2 hours straight and nothing happens. Then it reboots randomly again after some time.

Is this a feature of the FreeSync Premium Pro specification? Can HDR cause these issues? Btw. RE Village and Doom Eternal looks nice with HDR, clearly visible improvement even if it's not premium HDR 1000 experience. Remnant does not support HDR, capped at V-Sync 60Hz it just rebooted my PC on first tutorial mission.

Anyway, i'm running my monitor on 120Hz and now i remember that even Grim Dawn has crashed once or twice, but no hard reboot like the other games. Also with this new DELL monitor i have noticed at 60Hz power draw 30 watt. With custom refresh rate like 61Hz or my current 120Hz is power draw ""normal"" around 10 watt..

I have no UV/UC at this moment, running clean installation of Windows 10 21H1 just released with driver 21.5.2. Eventlog is not helpful, stating the obvious that previous system shutdown was unexpected..

I recently purchased a pre-built refurbished PC from Newegg (specs: AMD Ryzen 5 3600 3.20GHz, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD, AMD Radeon RX 5000 series, Windows 10 Pro). It said ""gaming,"" but it's constantly lagging and freezing during gameplay. Before buying, I checked the FPS benchmarks, and it should deliver at least 30 FPS in World of Warcraft or GTAIV, yet it's overheating and roaring so loud I'm afraid it'll die on me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I contacted Newegg, and they told me that my expectations for FPS weren't their responsibility. The PC works fine otherwise, so the lags aren't something they can help me with. As I see it, I currently have two options - look for a new GPU or somehow fix the one I have. 

I've upgraded drivers to the latest version I could find, 466.27, but it didn't help. Maybe I should replace the fan or thermal paste? I'd prefer to fix it because I think it'll be cheaper than splurging on a new GPU. 

But if it's unfixable, I'll obviously have to look for a new one that fits my pretty tight budget of $100. I've searched for ones from this list [https://techcompact.com/best-graphics-card-under-100/](https://techcompact.com/best-graphics-card-under-100/), but most of them are either ""currently unavailable"" or refurbished (I sure as hell not buying anything refurbished anymore).

&amp;#x200B;

I'd really appreciate any advice or tips on fixing my 1030 because I'd prefer this option over spending more money while having an otherwise working GPU. Maybe some drivers can get it up to snuff? Will the fan replacement actually help, or it'll be a waste of money?

Go to device manager and disable any ""AMD Radeon (TM) USB LED"" under the Human Interface Devices tree.

The 6900xt was lighting up with fans spinning so I unplugged the display port cable and plugged it back in.  It started just fine so I assumed I didn’t have it plugged in all the way originally and felt a bit dumb.

Performance was great.  Thermals were good, benchmarks were very good (RDR2, AC Odyssey) No issues at all except for TW3 oddly enough which had some strange stutters/fps drops.  Everything seemed fine until this morning when I tried starting it up and was met with grey static covering my monitor.  Sort of like an old tv and if you looked close enough you could actually some color in the static.

I turned it off and tried adjusting the display port cable again.  It started fine and after more testing, even more benchmarking and multiple restarts I can’t replicate the issue.  Normally I would think it obviously had something to do with the cable, but I hadn’t adjusted the cable from the night before when it was working perfectly and I’ve never had any issues like this before on my 1070.

I used DDU to remove Nvidia drivers beforehand and installed all the proper drivers/software for the 6900xt.  SAM is not enabled and the gpu bios is set to balanced.

Applied latest MSI UEFI update that includes AGESA [1.2.0.2](https://1.2.0.2).  Set everything back to PCIe 4.0.  Still have issues with USB resets, primarily on USB headset and webcam.  Explorer.exe also had issues with hanging during the USB device resets.  Doesn't matter which USB ports they're plugged into, doesn't matter if it's through a hub or directly into the motherboard.  

Setting things back to PCIe Gen 3 fixes about 90-95% of the resets/drop-outs, but not all of them.

To mitigate I ended up installing a USB 3.2 Gen 2 add-in card and setting only that slot to PCIe Gen 3 while leaving other slots and the chipset in Gen 4.  All USB devices are now going through the AIC in Gen 3.  So far that seems to have resolved the problem, though it's only been in for a few days.

Below is AMD's response to the ticket I submitted this week.  It's obviously a canned response, but it clearly admits they're aware of the issue and that it isn't fixed.

\--------------------

Thank you for your email.

I am sorry to hear that you are experiencing USB connectivity issues with your AMD 500 Series chipset motherboard. 

Our engineering team is activity investigating this issue with high priority and we will provide an update once a fix is available.

Based on user feedback we have received; the suggestions below could improve or resolve general USB device stuttering issues.

1.Verify that your motherboard is updated to the latest BIOS version and configured using optimized/factory default settings.

• Check your motherboard manufacturer’s website for BIOS update and download instructions.

2. Check if your Windows 10 is on the latest build and fully up to date.

• For information on updating Windows 10, please refer to Microsoft article: Update Windows 10

3. Ensure that the Ryzen chipset driver from AMD is installed and up to date.

• Latest Ryzen chipset driver version is 2.13.27.501 and can be download here.

If you continue to experience USB connectivity problems after following the suggestions above, you may consider using either of the following workaround:

1. Set PCIe mode from Gen4/Auto to Gen 3 in the BIOS

2. Disable Global C-State in the BIOS.

These settings are found in the BIOS. Please refer to the motherboard user manual if more information is needed.

Amd,Best way to contact AMD software team about their bug report tool not detecting Microsoft Store applications?,"Currently, AMD's software does not detect any application installed from the Microsoft Store. [A quick Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=amd+radeon+microsoft+store+games+detection) shows a handful of results where people have asked this before, but there are very few helpful replies.

I have been having a few issues with intermittent crashes while playing some games installed from the Microsoft Store. Sometimes, the AMD Bug Report Tool correctly detects a TDR event and prompts me to send in a report, however the ""Affected Game / Application"" field is required and any applications installed from the Microsoft Store are not visible in the dropdown. There is also no apparent way to manually add an application to the list. This means I am unable to send the report and am forced to just deal with it myself.

What is the best way to contact AMD's software team about adding support for Microsoft Store applications?

To reiterate: I know this post is light on details and am not expecting tech support from this alone. I want to be able to send bug reports to AMD when the intermittent crashes occur so they can figure this out, but Microsoft Store applications do not appear in their list.

Their amazon listings has been recieving negative reviews about this since they never disclosed this, forums on reddit have gotten tons of negative posts about this and we've seen zero coverage from popular reviewers and sites about this ''SCAM''

**Isn't it illegal to sell 2 different ram types under the same model number??** which perform differently in many workloads due to it being **single rank(shit) vs dual rank(awesome).** 16GB Single Rank modules(trash) should never be sold under the same model number and listings as   
16GB Dual rank(good).

**THIS IS A WARNING** for anyone wanting to get Crucial ballistix 32gb(2x16) Ram kits for their systems. You may never get that as Crucial does not disclose this.

Amd,Should I keep my 5900x or return it? (Upgrading from 3900x),"Hey everyone,

A few months ago, I built my system and had to settle on a 3900x as the 5900x wasn't in stock anywhere. A couple of weeks ago I got an alert on a parts finder discord server for a 5900x and immediately jumped to buy it. I just received it and am now contemplating whether or not I should swap them.

In terms of usage my rig gets, I have it mainly for motion graphics, 3D modeling/rendering and video editing. I also play Destiny 2 pretty much exclusively. Here is a full parts list:

&amp;#x200B;

MSI x570 Tomahawk MB

AMD 3900x CPU

EVGA 3080 FTW3 Ultra GPU

Lian Li Lancool II Mesh Case

Noctua NH-D15 CPU Cooler

3x Lian Li 120 Bora Digital Case Fans

Corsair RM 850x 80+ Gold PSU

16GBx2 (32GB) HyperX Fury 3600Mhz RAM

1TB WD Blue 2.5"" SATA3 SSD

500GB WD Black SN750 NVMe SSD

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is: for my usage, is it worth swapping these out? I understand on the gaming side I won't see that noticeable of a difference, but potentially in the rendering and video editing? Or is it worth waiting for the Zen4 AM5 socket type and upgrade my motherboard at the same time, saving $880 CAD after tax right now where I can either return it, or find someone locally who can benefit from it as actually landing one of these is almost impossible?

Amd,5700xt Reference Watercool for quiet Gaming (Buying advice),"Hello,

i have a reference 5700xt card. Since the updates from last year, the blower cooler is enough to make the job. But the cost for this is the fan noise volume. I wanted to buy a new GPU, but they are not available for the regular price. Only option would be water cooling it. Is the ""Alphacool Eiswolf 240 GPX Pro"" better in Cooling down the temperatures (Memory and Tj) and at being quiet? I heard the pumpnoise could be as much as loud as the blower fan and the temperatures of the memory would be even higher. Where is it just myth and what are the facts?

I know i have the performance already, but a complete custom waterloop would cost about 500€. Thats more than the price of a new 6700xt (which i can't buy). I dont want to waste above 300€.

I dont play very much gpu heavy games, but the noise is a real ambient killer when i once decide to play Witcher 3 or Tomb Raider on high settings. The noise is a lot lower since the updates, but in stressful days i just want to Game in silence (Like my idle noise amount 30 db).

Amd,ASUS Tuf Gaming x570-Pro vs MSI x570 Tomahawk,"I have a 5800x CPU, 32GB Crucial Ballistix 3600 Mhz CL16 RAM and I'm going to be replacing my B550 board with an x570 because I would like to run 2 PCIe4 nvme drives at full speed. I'm having a hard time deciding between these 2:

1) [Tuf Gaming x570-Pro Wifi](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-TUF-X570-PRO-Motherboard-Flashback/dp/B08JWMPVD9)

2) [x570 Tomahawk Wifi](https://www.amazon.com/MSI-MAG-X570-Tomahawk-WiFi/dp/B0892R8PDJ)

The prices are similar, with the Tomahawk being about $50 more, and both have similar specs. The differences I can see is that the Tuf Gaming has all USB 3 ports on the rear, while the Tomahawk has 2 USB 2. They have different audio chips, the TUF has a Realtek S1200A (8-Channel) and the Tomahawk has a Realtek ALC1200 (7.1-Channel). Also they have different ethernet controllers, the TUF has Intel I225-V 2.5Gigabit and the Tomahawk has Realtek 8125B 2.5Gigabit.

Amd,5900x core usage,"Hi everyone.

I'm working on dialing in my 5900x. A lot of the guides I've seen recommend playing with ryzen master to do some real time tweaking. I run cinebench and play with the PPT, TDC, and EDC values. In the multi-core test it's easy to see changes reflected since all the cores are pegged. However, I'm having trouble dialing in a single core. When I run the single core test, the core being used jumps around too fast for one core to peg. I'm seeing it jump all over, instead of staying on one core.

Has anyone else seen this behavior? Is there a reason it's not just sticking to a single core, and running its whole process there?

Amd,Anybody else having strange OpenGL visual corruption on 6000-series cards?,"I upgraded from a 5700XT to a 6700XT and ever since, I'm seeing strange artifacting (not the dying GPU kind) in certain OpenGL scenarios and cannot pin down what is causing it.

Examples:

1. https://i.postimg.cc/tgZXVvqR/opengl1.png

2. https://i.postimg.cc/Hxbd6J8f/opengl2.png

3. https://i.postimg.cc/Dz97QQ0r/opengl3.png

The first one is from Heaven, the second 2 are OpenGL Shadertoy demos in GPU Caps Viewer. This only happens with OpenGL.

If I go through the other demos that all highlight a specific effect, it looks fine. In some demos that use multiple effects, I get that kind of corruption.

I play Planetary Annihilation that still uses OpenGL, and it's causing weird behaviour with textures where they don't join up, and it results in a grid effect.

I've tried DDU which has done nothing and the problem has existed in 21.4.1, 21.5.1 and 21.5.2.

Is it just me, or is there an issue with OpenGL on 6000-series cards?

The computer is being used mainly for Firefox or Chrome. The company has a NetSuite system that's notoriously slow even on the fastest of fibre connections.

Multiple games I regularly (Modern Warfare 2019, Overwatch, Apex Legends, Escape From Tarkov, Forza Horizon 4, and lately it seems like every game I try) have been crashing a lot recently. Typically these crashes have some sort of error relating to DirectX, typically Dev Error 6068 and error 0x887a0006 for Modern Warfare, and DXGI\_ERROR\_Device\_HUNG for Apex Legends, and I'm at my wit's end for what's wrong. I've been having this issue for a bit and ended up having to RMA my GPU due to a crash causing my displays not to function and ended being sent an entirely new card but the issues still continue.  


**So far I have tried:**

* Overclocking both GPU and CPU (one site said this would fix one of the errors) (I also wonder if ram could be the issue if so how could I check that?)
* I have tried replacing thermal paste (one site said an error could be heat related though I haven't noticed thermal throttling)  

* I have tried undervolting my GPU
* I have completely reinstalled the games, my drivers, and windows (windows 3 times now)
* I have reverted to older drivers that I know the game worked properly on.
* I have updated Bios and Chipsets.
* I have tried default Bios settings.
* And I have tried running the games as admin as well.

**Extra Info:**

* The crashing doesn't seem to be consistent always specifically for Call of Duty sometimes it's whenever I finish a match, sometimes it's when I first join a match, and sometimes it's right after I get to the main menu after launching.
* Oh and I also sometimes get a pop-up from the AMD software stating a driver timeout has occurred.
* When looking at event viewer errors relating to these games come up as Application hang with the Hang type being Top level window is idle.
* Forza simply freezes then crashes to desktop idk what is causing that one.

**System Specs:**

* CPU Ryzen 5 1600X
* RAM G.Skillz Ripjaws V 32GB @ 3000Mhz
* GPU RX 5700XT THICC III (was originally THICC II but was sent THICC III after RMA)
* PSU Thermaltake Smart Series 700W

Amd,New drivers and the 5700XT stable?,"Just wanting to ask this here because I've had persistent issues with my 5700XT ever since I got it. Regular crashing to a green screen and then rebooting. I finally found a stable driver from May of 2020 year and following another user's advice also underclocked the card by 2%. It's been working pretty well, but there are still some games (X4 Foundations) that threaten to crash if I run them along with other things like a twitch stream.(screens flicker, and at that point I know I have to shut the game down or risk another crash)

All this said, I just got an email from AMD stating a new driver was released, and was wondering about how stable it is, or if there are still crashing issues with the 5700XT? I'm just wanting to ask so I don't upgrade my driver's and find myself in a similar spot as the other month.

To be clear, my card before this was an R9 390, and besides the one and final time it failed and kicked the bucket, it ran flawlessly and I never had crashing issues like I have with the 5700XT.

Amd,VR Performance of the 6900XT with latest drivers,"So i got a ""fairly good deal"" on a 6900xt last month. Because of time constraints i only got around to the test the card last weekend in VR and i was fairly underwhelmed. Atleast with HL:Alyx and the GTA V real mod(I havent got around to test further titles because i troubleshooted both titles since then). Performance really wasnt something you'd expect from a 1000$/€ card.

Considering the card should fire up an Index with 144hz in HL:Alyx on Ultra i was really weirded out my card couldnt even hold 80fps with my Facebook Rift S. Also GTA5 real mod felt much sloppier than on the 5700xt i used use before that.

So far i got HL:Alyx running as expected by reverting back to the Adrenalin 21.3.1 Driver. Not super excited about it but its a fairly easy fix.

The real mod stills runs absolutly horrible. Even with the low settings provided by the mod i average 60fps at best. With high settings which should be the go to for such an expensive card it drops down to 30fps. Not great for the stomach considering that the mod uses alternate eye rendering. Dont get me wrong it cant be expected that an unofficial mod runs perfectly out of the box but i'm still a bit bummed about it. 

I dont really know where i want to go with my post now really. But if you also experience bad performance with VR title i suggest you revert back to Adrenalin 21.3.1 and maybe somebody else also found a way to run the GTA V real mod on Big Navi somewhat performant? I expect some issue with the fairly aggresive powersaving plan which kicks in because of the alternate eye rendering. Clocks and usage are jumping all over the place when running the game.

PS btw Pancake performance is pretty great and as expected. Also the card suits me in that regard really well because i still run 1080p monitors and am not too excited about the current state of raytracing. So its pretty much the best card for my needs except for the current state of the VR implentation in the drivers i guess.",False,3,0,1,0

## Radeon Software Adrenalin 21.5.2 Highlights

## Support For

* Days Gone
* Microsoft® DirectX® 12 Agility SDK &amp; Microsoft® Shader Model 6.6
   * Learn more from AMD [here](https://community.amd.com/t5/blogs/create-incredible-gaming-experiences-with-amd-amp-microsoft/ba-p/465414) and Microsoft [here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/announcing-dx12agility/).

## Fixed Issues

* Uninstalling or upgrading Radeon Software using the factory reset option may delete AMD chipset driver folders if they are stored in the same directory as the Radeon Software installation. Users who wish to perform a factory reset are recommended to use the latest AMD cleanup utility instead.
* Cyberpunk 2077™ may experience shadow corruption on Radeon RX 6000 series graphics when ray tracing is enabled.
* Intermittent loss of signal during AMD Link’s Stream Optimization if HEVC is used on Radeon RX 5000 series graphics products or later.
* The download or launch Ryzen Master buttons in Radeon Software may intermittently disappear or may fail to initialize Ryzen Master.
* FPS logging may log incorrectly or fail to log on RyzenTM Mobile 4000 series and RyzenTM Mobile 5000 series.
* Radeon Software may experience a crash when Record &amp; Stream tab is in use and a display is hot plugged.

## Known Issues

* Radeon™ Software might not get updated on Windows 7 platforms when updating from 21.4.1 or 21.5.2 to this release, if factory reset is enabled. As a workaround, users who wish to perform a factory reset are recommended to use the latest AMD cleanup utility instead.
* Resident Evil Village™ may experience an intermittent application hang or TDR on AMD Radeon VII graphics products in the first mission of the game.
* Enhanced Sync may cause a black screen to occur when enabled on some games and system configurations. Any users who may be experiencing issues with Enhanced Sync enabled should disable it as a temporary workaround.
* Connecting two displays with large differences in resolution/refresh rates may cause flickering on Radeon RX Vega series graphics products.
* Radeon performance metrics and logging features may intermittently report extremely high and incorrect memory clock values.
* Radeon FreeSync™ may intermittently become locked while on desktop after performing task switching between extended and primary displays upon closing a game, causing poor performance or stuttering. A system restart is a potential workaround if this is experienced.
* If Ryzen Master is not detected in Adrenalin software after installation, a system restart may be required.
* If Blue or Black screen is observed in mobile systems, temporarily disable Enhanced sign-in

## AMD Link for Windows Known Issues

* Intermittent grey frame corruption might be observed when streaming with HEVC on certain configurations via an Internet connection. A workaround is to use the AVC encoding setting instead.

Amd,OC Ryzen 5 3600 @ 4.45GHz -&gt; 4.5GHz?,"Hi,

this is my first post on r/Amd.

I was searching for a new cooler, to keep my Ryzen 5 3600 under 90°C when running at 100% Cpu load for rendering and mechanical simulations. So I ended up buying a used wraith prism for 5€. Although this wasnt a big upgrade from the stock cooler, I decided to try some overclocking.

I just followed a tutorial on YouTube which told me 1.28 Volts is safe, so I put in 1.28v and started increasing the frequence from 3.6 to 4.2 to 4.3 to 4.4 and finally to 4.5 where my pc crashed during the stress test. So I put in 4.45GHz and it ran flawless since then.

Cinebench R23 scores are:

Multic Core: 10268 --&gt; 96.8°C max

Single Core: 1319

My questions now are: Is it safe to increase the Voltage, how much would I have to increase it to get my pc running stable on 4.5GHz and would it even be worth it?

Amd,Overclocking Question on 5600x,"I recently got a 5600x. I have played around with PBO, Curve Optimizer, and straight up fixed multiplier.

Currently I am running PBO with curve optimizer. The settings are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

* PBO Limits: Mobo
* PBO Scalar: 1X
* Curve Optimizer: negative 5,5,10,15,15 (with -5 on my best 2 threads)
* Max Core Boost override: 300Mhz
* Thermal throttle Limit: 90 deg

I then also set a vcore voltage offset of -0.2v. I had to do this because just running PBO with Curve Optimizer was pushing temps into the 70s and pushing VID to 1.45v

In game (with RTSS and HWINFO) I am measuring 4,850Mhz all core at around 1.22v and my temp stays at around 50deg (balanced mode).

So my questions are:

\- Is the core clock maxing out at 4,850 due to only setting 300 on the boost override (and somehow AMD interprets it as 4,850 and not 4,900)?

\- Would curve optimizer still be used by the mobo even if I have a vcore voltage offset? I have noticed that in-game all my cores are pushing the same voltage at the max frequency which I would not have expected if curve optimizer was being used.

\- How do I get curve optimizer to work better so that I don't have to set a static vcore offset? Is it as simple as just increasing the neg values in the optimizer until I find the limit? I just don't understand why the mobo would push so much volts to the core unless required.

Setup as follows:

* Mobo: asus tuf gaming plus (x570)
* CPU: 5600x
* GPU: Asus rtx2080 super oc
* RAM: XPG spectrix 3200mhz (xmp enabled)

All guides online say to disable the shader cache through the Nvidia control panel, restarting, then reinstalling the driver with a clean installation. The final step would then be deleting the DirectX shader cache through disk cleanup, re-enabling the shader cache and restarting again. 

It seems like the option to disable the shader cache through the Radeon software was removed and I can only preform a shade cache reset, which does nothing to help solve the stuttering in game.

Amd,Amd software 21.4.1 and 21.5.1 causes stuttering?,"

 

basically, when I download the drivers just before finishes installation it goes black screen and then i have to put the computer into sleep mode then restart. Then it says its finishes installation then starts flickering then i need to restart properly. After that, it is fine unless the computer then sleeps after not being on for some time ( its a gaming laptop) and when usually a spacebar tap should turn it on it goes black screen again. Also when i change refresh rate or when I toggle Virtual Super Resolution or GPU scaling it does the flickering again. I searched this up and the solution was to uninstall dragon center and that doesn't do anything, even when i uninstall everything AMD Radeon software and re install. I've tried with both 21.4.1 and 21.5.1. I then decided to just do the windows update driver AMD display and I think that downloaded the original driver and software version that the laptop originally came with. 

I get stuttering even when uninstalling with ddu ,I think the windows update one it originally came with was 21.3.1 or 21.3.2 and there’s no issues what so ever no change in FPS no decrease in performance so do you think it would be fine for now?

# Summary of Issue

Lately in the last few days my PC is crashing left and right within a few minutes of starting ANY game. My PC goes full black screen, the monitors go with ""No Input Signal"" and I can still hear sound for around 10 seconds, and after that the sound kind of turns into an annoying and loud ""stuck sound"", and my whole PC reboots.

# System Configuration

**Motherboard**: MSI B350M Gaming Pro

**CPU**: AMD RYZEN 5 1600 @ 3.2 GHz

**PSU**: SEASONIC S12II 520W 80+ BRONZE

**Display**: Double AOC 24"" 24G2U 144Hz DP (1080p 144Hz) - using with Display Port

**System Memory**: G.SKILL TRIDENT Z 32GB DDR4 3200MHZ

**GPU** (VBIOS): GIGABYTE Radeon RX580 Gaming 8GB GD5 (VBIOS: shows up as xxx-xxx-xxx?)

**OS** (Version): Windows 10 Pro x64 (Version: 19042.985) (Version: 20H2)

**Driver**: Radeon Software Adrenalin 2020 Edition 20.11.2 - Was using 21.4.1 and tried to revert to 20.11.2, still getting crashes

**Applications**: Any game. Dead By Daylight, Total War: Rome II, Assetto Corsa Competizione, etc

**Background Apps**: Steam, Discord, Spotify

**Radeon Software Settings**: Everything disabled, including Freesync and Enchanced Sync

# Steps to Reproduce

1 - Start any game

2 - Start playing, after a few minutes game turns to black

3 - Can still hear sound for a few seconds and after that, sound gets ""stuck"" in a loud loop

4 - Whole PC restarts

Can't see any flickering or performance drop at all

I bought a brand new 5800X for a NR200 Gaming rig and Gigabyte B550i Aorus Pro AX (thankfully it was updated to F10 Bios with Ryzen 5000 support OOB). 

Besides it being a hot boi it produces WHEA 18 and 19. 

I am using crucial ballistix sport lt micron rev e 3200MHz Dual Rank 2x16GB. Those sticks did run in my x570 3900X system without a sweat at 3800MHz. I run testmem5 extreme profiles for hours at 3600MHz and don’t get errors in testmem5, but hwinfo64 shows errors. Checking windows I did get some whea 19. BiOS is the latest beta, even tried the one before over the weekend.

It’s impossible to not get whea on this gigabyte - even on 3200MHz and tighter timings 14-17-14-14-32. I tried all the voltages on ram, I have good airflow on an open bench with extra fans. 

I did use XMP profile with bios default settings on cyberpunk and forza. Cyberpunk crashes, sometimes system reboots. Forza horizon 4 blue screens whea within minutes of driving a car.

PSU I tried: 600w platinum sf600, rm850x gold. 
Two sets of ram. Only thing I could try is the x570 but I kinda need that 3900X working.

When this kept on happening, I just DDU'ed in safe mode and didn't install the driver altogether. There was no Radeon Software at all, so I was even wondering how games were running at all. Witcher 3, Hitman I&amp;III, Divinity Original Sin all ran great. I noticed that (It just crashed again when I typed around here. Nothing was playing in the background this time.) nothing was crashing. I mean NOTHING. All the GPU utilization were fine. Youtube was running fine. Firefox didn't crash. Everything was dandy.

Amd,Bad thermal compound application? Ryzen 5950X temperatures seem high,"Hi - I just upgraded my CPU yesterday from a 3900X to a 5950X. 

I have an MSI X570 ACE motherboard with a Noctua NH-D15 CPU cooler.

With my 3900X, my system idle (screen off and PC locked) temperatures were fairly consitant - roughly 34 - 38 DegC, with occasional spikes up to 45 DegC or so.

With my new 5950X, my system idle temperatures are much higher and more ""spiky"" - roughly 40 - 50 DegC, with more frequent spikes up to around 59 DegC.

Is this normal for the 5950X? Or, did I do a bad job applying my Thermal Grizzly thermal compound?

AMD graphics cards don't handle tessellation as well as nVidia's do, turning the setting down might gain you a few FPS, without compromising visual fidelity.","You might remember a few years ago when AMD created a hair graphics library called TressFX, it worked well on AMD cards and it worked actually even a little bit better on nVidia cards, too.  

nVidia, not to be outdone, came up with their own hair graphics package called HairWorks, and it ran incredibly well on nVidia GPUs, but absolutely destroyed performance on AMD GPUs.  
  
After a little bit of sleuthing it was discovered that nVidia had cranked HairWorks tessellation up to an absurd amount, like 64x, which not only didn't provide any additional visual fidelity to the hair, but had the added bonus of exploiting one of the weaknesses of their competitor's products.  The solution was a simple one, though: Go into the AMD control panel (Then Catalyst, now Adrenaline) and manually turn the tessellation setting down.  
  
WCCFTech: [The Witcher 3 – How to Run HairWorks on AMD GPUs Without Crippling Performance](https://wccftech.com/witcher-3-run-hairworks-amd-gpus-crippling-performance/)  
  
AMD cards can handle Tessellation levels of anywhere from 2x to 16x pretty well, and there really isn't much *subjective visual improvement* after 16x anyway, at least not in current modern games, and I run my Vega 64 at 8x tessellation without a problem.  I set the tessellation level globally, then if I'm having any problems, or just want the redundancy, I'll go in and create a game specific profile as well.

Repasted with kryonaut but juction temps are still high at 96c which i know its within spec but i still want to lower it a bit more. Now i saw id cooling released their iceflow 240 aio cooler a while back  and read some amazon reviews saying that it works with 6000 series as long as the pcb design is like vega .

Amd,A noob seeking some clarity on undervolting/overclocking his 5900x,"Hi guys,
So I recently purchased a Ryzen 5900x (motherboard is an Aorus x570 Master with BIOS F33j and cooler is an NZXT Kraken X73 360mm). I am very new to overclocking and undervolting so I read a lot of posts on /r/AMD, /r/GigabyteGaming etc to at least get a basic grasp of what I'm getting myself into and how to go about doing this the right way. After catching up with all that, I experimented a lot and landed on these PBO settings:

**PBO Limits: Motherboard

PBO Scalar: 3x

Boost clock override: 50MHz

CO: -30 all core

Thermal Limits: 90
**

and on my motherboard, I did these:

**CPU LLC: Turbo

SOC LLC: Turbo

Spread spectrun control: Disabled

Global C-state control: Disabled

AMD Cool&amp;Quiet Mode: Disabled

CPU Vcore current protection: Extreme

CPU Vcore protection: 400mV

CPU Vcore SOC current protection: 400mV

PWM Phase control: Extreme performance

CPPC: Enabled

CPPC preferred cores: Enabled
**

Now, as I read stability testing is very crucial, I read up on that as well and got to know about Cinebench (20/23), Prime95, OCCT, Y-cruncher and AIDA64. So, I ran OCCT for 1hr (the free version only allows that) and got no BSODs/reboots. Next, I found out about this handy script called ""CoreCycler"" and using that, I ran both AIDA64 and Prime95.

For Prime95, I turned on AVX (not AVX2), set it to 2 threads, selected the Smallest FFT preset (as I read this is the best for stability testing), set the script running time to auto (which tests all FFT sizes in the selected preset) and ran the script for 8 iterations and got no reboots/BSODs. Similarly, for AIDA64, I ran the script for 10m per core and enbaled AVX and no problems here as well.

Now for CB20/23, though they both ran properly for both single and multi core, I am getting quite low scores (~7800 MC in CB20 and ~19K MC in CB23) and I suspect this is due to the really high undervolt (-30) that I did. But regarding the curve optimizer, I've read a 3 mixed things:

1. Some people say to undervolt your best/second-best cores the highest as they are the most efficient ones and set a lower UV to your worst cores so they can boost properly.
2. Some others say the exact opposite of point 1.
3. Yet others actually say to give a small positive offset to your best cores as they can use that voltage to boost higher frequencies.

Thus, I'm really torn regarding these 3 statements and so I ask you guys to tell me which one is the appropriate thing to follow (or if it is somehow a situational thing that depends on your chip's binning) so that I can further tune my curve properly as imho, all-core UV is simply not the way. I can see people here posting scores that average between 21K MC in CB23 so I at least want to land somewhere near that (I know running after scores is worthless but I think mine is simply too low due to the worse undervolting I did).

Also, please advice me on proper stability testing as I, being new to all of this could've very well done it all wrong.

Thank you for reading this really long post and I'd really appreciate any advice I can get on all of this or pointing out any wrong things I've done.",False,31,0,1,0

Likewise, in Radeon Software, it would be great to modify or replace the fan control curve section of the Performance Tuning section to more accurately reflect your cooling situation.

I am fucking tired of this shit. Warzone is well known for being poorly optimized for pc. Now in my case I never had any issued within almost the first year of playing the game. At some point i started getting fps issues. Usually i could run the game 90-100 fps at 1080p and almost maxed graphics. Tbh results varied slightly based on how i adjusted graphics settings. For some reason, my game started stuttering in a way that made it completely unplayable. I read a thread that advised me to change the games priority in task manager’s details i believe. Its usually set to “high” and it should be “normal” at least. I dont understand what it had to do with, but it worked. At least to my recollection, i think it solved the porblem... temporarily. I kept getting problems, so then i decided to do a factory reset. I wiped my pc clean and it all got fixed. But after i installed my amd driver (adrenalin) i started getting issues again. If i have it uninstalled, its nowhere nearly as fucked up. The game would run smoothly, whether i had vsync on or off with my fps capped  at any number or unlimited. But once i had my driver installed, every 10 seconds my game stutters. It is fucking annoying. I have no clue on what to do. Of course i can just keep the driver uninstalled, but i need it. I want it for clipping gaming moments and to modify color saturation to improve visibility. I try to look for solutions online, but most videos are dedicated to Nvidia, they either rely on changing the game’s graphics settings and some settings in window’s as well. Maybe i should try to improve performance through my driver’s settings, but ive tried it before when everything worked well, and theres no reason to believe that it would fix the problems im having now. Ive read threads that talk about people with specs that i would wish to have, and still have problems with fps stutter/lag in this game. Wtfffff?

Currently, I am sitting at 4550 Mhz on both CCD0 and CCD1 at 1.320 Voltage with Dynamic Overclocking at 75 Amps switching frequency. My ram is Overclocked from 3600 c16 to 3800 c16 tightened timings (4 sticks of 16 gb) with FCLK 1900 mhz (1:1:1).

In Cinebench R20, I achieved a Multi Core score of 11,851 and a Single Core score of 633. My max temperatures are approximately 83-90 degrees celsius with a custom fan curve on my NH-D15 starting at 70% at 55 degrees celsius going up to 100% at 65 degrees celsius. 

When I run Cinebench R20 my SVI2 TFN Core voltage drops to around 1.225 V. 

I am wondering if my temperature and performance results are in-line with other users or if my CPU is running too hot. I am wondering if I should re-paste my CPU. I used mostly NT-H1 and had to add a dab of Arctic Silver 5 as I ran out of NT-H1 (I know you should not mix thermal pastes).

Amd,Figured Out The Source of My New Found Coil Whine,"Hey everyone,

I was lucky enough to snag an RX6800 from AMD direct buy last week. Everything works great except I noticed in most games (especially Valorant, CS GO i.e. games that can push high fps) that my PSU was exhibiting coil whine now, to varying degrees. And it's definitely coming directly from the PSU.  


I was re-installing drivers etc. basically just troubleshooting to see if there was anything I could do about it. I figured it was just the increase in power required for the new GPU (previously had an RX5700) and that I would eventually upgrade the PSU.  


I opened up Valorant and started changing my settings back in the adrenalin software to see if maybe some settings in the software were causing it.. seemed like a long shot. I noticed right away that when it was back at default, there was less coil whine. I thought that was interesting as I didn't have an OC or anything on my card. The next thing I noticed is when I opened the overlay (alt-r), coil whine ramped up but would go away when I closed it. The major culprit happened to be Radeon Instant Replay, however. When I have it on there is coil whine that doesn't ever stop until I close down the game....  


Does anybody know why this is? Is instant replay really drawing more power? Does opening up the overlay really draw enough power to make a PSU exhibit coil whine? Has anyone noticed this or know of any potential solution? I would like to continue to use the instant replay function.. I currently just leave it on but I might have to turn it on and off depending on when I may want to record gameplay because the coil whine bugs me....

After emailing TPU with a bug report and following up with many screenshots and registry excerpts, w1zzard @ TPU (the developer of GPU-Z) is confident that rBAR is, in fact, enabled and working, despite not presenting in the typical fashion.

So, I think it'd be really helpful if the AMD Radeon Control Panel could indicate as such.

(Fwiw, Nvidia has recently added this to their Control Panel.)

Amd,3900x to 5800x worth it?,"Hi,

i've been thinking about upgrading my 3900x to a 5800x for the last couple of weeks, but wasnt really sure, whether it would be worth it that much.

I got the 3900x mainly for gaming+streaming back then: CCD0 for the game and CCD1 for OBS, but since then managed to get myself a Nvenc-capable GPU, which is perfectly fine for streaming (720p) and more than enough for me.

PC is being used for CPU-intensive games at 1440p, such as WarZone, Battlefield, Rust, EFT etc...

Would the higher boost-clocks and it being one CCX instead of 2CCD x 2 CCX make a major difference?

I know i might also be held back by 3200CL16 memory (Samsung C-Die, no OC-potential)... would probably upgrade that aswell.

I was promised an RTX 3090 for a relatively low price and have been waiting for quite some time (as has everyone else), however as it turned out I was told I shall no longer be receiving said RTX 3090 and by that time prices had gone up considerably - RTX 3090's are priced at around $2800-$4200 in my country IF and WHEN they're even in stock. I have been contacting pretty much every store in my country for the past month ""begging"" for a chance to be able to purchase a GPU, however all of them told me they don't really do queues. I begun to notice people were getting their GPUs through connections and/or special deals, as the first come first serve basis for doing business made it impossible for me and everyone else to have a chance at completing an actual purchase.

Amd,"New UEFI BIOS updates for ASUS AMD motherboards W19 - 3 Motherboards - B550, X570, R1505G","&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1pvadpl6h4z61.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb67e696ca9c94881cd1f803e4e35294a7d4a250

  

**New UEFI BIOS updates** 

**For ASUS AMD and Intel motherboards – W19**

\*Please do not ask about motherboards not listed. Please review the FAQ below for details.  
 

**AMD – B550, X570, R1505G**

&amp;#x200B;

**UEFI BIOS update list noted below – A total of**  3 **boards with a UEFI BIOS update.**

**W19 is in relation to the workweek, these updates were released between the April 30 – May 12th**

&amp;#x200B;

***Why is my motherboard not listed?***

It may have been recently updated. Check https://www.asus.com/us/support/ to see if it has been. I post updates on a weekly basis. UEFI’s are released in waves, because of this it can take an entire series weeks or months to see the “same” update if it includes items like CPU firmware. Furthermore, keep in mind that not all updates are applicable to all models. Due to inherent design differences as well as specification and feature variation an update may only be applicable to a specific model.

&amp;#x200B;

***How can I be notified about UEFI updates when they are released?***

If you want to be kept in the loop, you can also follow me for notifications when updates are released/posted. I am also the admin for our PCDIY Facebook Group where I post updates and other ASUS centric product news [https://www.facebook.com/groups/ASUSPCDIY](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ASUSPCDIY)

&amp;#x200B;

***How long after a board is produced will UEFI updates be released?***

Keep in mind that generally after a year a motherboard reaches a certain maturity level and as such will see fewer updates. If you feel you have an issue that is dependent on a UEFI release, please submit a support ticket. In some cases, some boards can see updates for more than 24 months+

&amp;#x200B;

***I want to update but am not sure how to update the UEFI ""BIOS""?***

If you want guidance on how to flash/update your UEFI BIOS please watch the video linked below.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scK8AP8ZACc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scK8AP8ZACc)

&amp;#x200B;

***Should I update the UEFI if my system is stable and running without issue?***

If your system is running without issue, especially if overclocked in any way ( including DRAM ) it is advised you stay on the build/release you are on. Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can change the OC experience and require you to retune a previously stable OC value. This does not mean the UEFI is not a functioning release but that changes in the underlying code base need to be accounted for when tuning a system. As many of these values are in low level or specific operating parameters it is best to retune from full UEFI defaults after you have re-run stability test at UEFI defaults.

&amp;#x200B;

***What if the UEFI BIOS listed is a BETA? Should I update?***

BETA UEFI releases are for enthusiasts who want access to the latest features, functions, and microcode enhancements, and overall UEFI improvements. As they are not officially supported, they are not recommended for day-to-day / long-term use. Users who plan to use their system in this capacity and want to ensure the best interoperability/compatibility and stability, as well as performance, should wait for a formal release.  
 

***How long does it take for a formal release to be issued (between BETA and formal)?***

The time span between a BETA and formal release can vary depending on multiple factors including new internal code being provided, validation and qualification as well as other important aspects of UEFI development and validation. Generally, you will see a formal release within 1 to 3 months. In some cases, BETAs are singular releases and will not see a formal release.

***Will a UEFI ""BIOS"" update improve the performance of my system?***

A UEFI update can include CPU microcode as well as other performance tuning enhancements that can influence/increase performance. With this noted it is generally minimal. As always performance analysis/comparisons should be done at stock-to-stock values. This means loading F5 on both releases and comparing your application/benchmark scores. OC-related comparisons may require retuning prior to testing as changes to underlying auto rules can invalidate prior scores even if with similar settings.

***Not every user should update/flash their UEFI BIOS. I stress this again, if you are running without issue(s) you are advised to stay on the release you are running.*** 

***Notes to consider -***

***\* When flashing please perform the update process at full UEFI defaults. Do NOT flash with an overclocked system/profile.***

1.I recommend updating the UEFI BIOS on your motherboard for new PC builds. This helps to ensure the best interoperability, compatibility, and performance. If you are building a PC and have not yet installed the OS, I would recommend you update the UEFI.

2.Keep in mind flashing/updating the UEFI will reset all defined parameters/settings and operating profiles. You will not be able to restore defined values by using a UEFI Profile as profiles are not interoperable between builds. It is advised you note or screenshot (F12) your values prior to flashing if they are complex. Upon completing a flash, I would recommend you load UEFI defaults after the fact and complete a full reboot and shutdown prior to re-entering your prior values. Keep in mind you may need to retune these values under a new UEFI.

3.When you update the UEFI and re-load UEFI defaults depending on your originally defined CSM/UEFI device parameters you may experience BOOT issues. Depending on prior settings you may need to enable or disable CSM to restore BOOT functionality.

4.Be advised that in some cases a rollback to a prior UEFI is not possible. This generally is the case when there is an update that includes CPU microcode (such as an AMD AEGSA or Intel ME). This means you may not be able to “flashback” to a prior release.

5.While not always necessary some UEFI updates may require a clearing of the CMOS. You can either clear the CMOS via the CLR CMOS button if your motherboard has this feature/function or you can also CLR CMOS by removing the onboard CMOS battery for at least a few minutes. You can also attempt to locate the CLR CMOS jumper on the motherboard and short the pins.

6.In some cases, you may not be able to jump from an older UEFI release to a much newer release. You may need to ""step"" update, this will mean upgrading incrementally to a slightly newer build first prior to going to the most recent build/release. In most situations this not required.

I also recommend you backup your system prior to any flash/update and always advise flash/update become executed from a fresh loading (F5) of UEFI defaults.

The board model/name is on the right-hand side and the version number is on the left-hand side. To download the UEFI BIOS please go to https://www.asus.com/support/

Amd,What Is The Viability Of BIOS Modding A 5700xt For Gaming?,"X-Posted From /r/radeon and /r/overclocking. Just looking for any advice or input on this endeavor. 

Just dipping my toes into the idea of BIOS modding, and all the guides for a 5700xt are centered around Ethereum mining. I mine when I'm not gaming, but after this current payout in a day or two, I'm stopping for.

After fixing my [heat issues]https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/n7cyo9/i_cant_believe_this_worked_or_how_i_stopped/), I've got a really stable 2150mhz at 1100mv, with memory at 1850mhz. BUT There could be more?

The main mod I see out there for my card is for copying the 1500mhz memory timings to the higher frequencies &amp; a little bit of power limit unlocking.

I understand timing adjustments on system ram, but completely out of my element on Vram. Would I see an appreciable gain in games? Or is there already a bios out there I can flash?

Any advice is welcome to help get a little more juice out of this card. Online resources for this particular card are ONLY for ETH mining, and I don't know if those settings would be effective for games. Like, if you have a computer that is really good for gaming, it will do web browsing and other tasks well. Does the same correlation hold true for mining and games?

My current laptop is a Lenovo I5-6300HQ with 12 GB ram and GTX 950M graphics.  It's starting to show it's age, getting slow and I'd like to retire it.  I usually only use it for some older games, Bioshock, Fallout, Guild Wars 2, etc with an XBOX being my main gaming system these days for most other AAA titles.

I'm set on getting an Alienware Ryzen, but am stuck on a few choices.  CPU of Ryzen 7 5800H or Ryzen 9 5900HX, Display of FHD or QHD on a 15 inch, and will I benefit from a 3070 over the 3060 GPU?

I was also recommended to do a fresh re-install of Windows 10, which I did not do yet. I believe unless Windows 10 auto updated chipset drivers, I also did not manually download any chipset drivers.

&amp;#x200B;

My current Ryzen Master settings are PPT 89W, TDC 54A and EDC 108A with Boost Override at 125Mhz.

&amp;#x200B;

In Cinebench R23 clocks start at 4.55GHz and slowly go down to 4.4GHz due to rising temperatures up to 85C\~ with an average score of 11405\~

On Single Core I see the CPU constantly keeps switching between the gold star and silver cores, frequencies around 4750-4770Mhz with around 71C \~ degrees and a score of around 1585\~

&amp;#x200B;

It looked like, to me at least, curve optimizer did not agree at all with the silver and gold cores, proving unstable in single core even at negative 5 offset on these two (program crashing with a bug report), while the other cores are atm somewhere between -10 to -15, in multithread test at first I was going -30 on Core 0, -25 on Core 1 etc, I just dialed all of these back to see why the program was crashing exactly, once I set the best 2 cores at 0 curve optimizer it didn't crash anymore. So far I did not go back to fine-tune the other cores.

&amp;#x200B;

Tried boost override to +150, +200 but the clocks seemed to have dialed back instead compared to +125 Mhz.",False,23,0,1,0

Amd,Guidance on moving from Intel to AMD?,"Hey everyone

I'm contemplating moving from an Intel-powered laptop to an AMD one. 

I'm not very knowledgeable on computer hardware at all. I'm considering this move based on reviews and articles on the performance difference between laptops with Ryzen chips and those with corresponding Intel chips.

I'm not a gamer. The most significant usage of my laptop is in browsers. I normally have multiple browsers (Firefox, Edge, Vivaldi) open with 150-200+ tabs in total. Alongside the hundreds of browser tabs, a music player, the Windows email client and Discord, I occasionally also have VS Code running to do front-end development. Could I expect better performance from a Ryzen laptop for this use case?

Also, should I expect any kind of software incompatibility issues in moving from my current laptop to a Ryzen device? And is there anything else I should prepare for?

1. Did you ever experience any issues with this motherboard?
2. If yes, then what problems you had and were they fixed?
3. If yes, then how were the problems fixed? (e.g. BIOS update or a different workaround like removing the CMOS battery as mentioned in the video)

I have a very weird problem.

One random day i decided to open my bios, and i came across the cpu voltage at 1.45+ (extremely high without oc) . I use a mobo biostar x470 gtn (horrible bios).

First: why the hell is the vcore so high? 

Second: I have no option to decrease the voltage, I only have the option to increase the voltage even further, there are 4 options called ""negative -1 -2 -3 and -4"" if I use -3 the computer or turn on, if I use the -2 my vcore is at 1.3.  but as follows the image in the cpuz informs a vcore, in aida informs another, in the ryzen master another and in HWmonitor another.  Does anyone know how this is possible and which one is right?

I am open to other options; I am leaning towards the x570 for the dual pcie-4 slots for increased video/photo storage, but could go for a B550 if it performs better for a better price. Budget is under 400. Any thoughts? Or am I overthinking this too much?

I checked the Events Log of Windows and the most common errors was:

""app.exe blocked from acessing graphics hardware"" - this happened with Cold War, Warzone and RE:8 mostly. Open the games as Administrator worked for a while. Set Power Limit to ""-10%"" worked well too, but doesn't solve the problem. This erros happened with the Radeon Software too, and that made the games freezes and crash.

""display driver amdwddmg stopped responding and has successfully recovered"" - happened too. Actually, when wasn't the first error, this second happened. 

I checked the dates of the errors in the Log, and they started after I downloaded the 21.4.1 and 21.5.1. No of the erros of then happened when was the 21.3.2 (and are not happening now, because I back to 21.3.2).

The erros happened some times after Windows Defender event started. I don't know if have any relation, but doesn't happens with the 21.3.2.

I am specifically planning an APU build because GPU prices currently don't seem reasonable, hoping that the prices will normalise at some point in the future. Do you think I may be wrong about it ? Because I am also thinking that perhaps cryptocurrency prices will not crash and continue to rise, creating more and more demand on GPUs, causing their prices to rise even further even if the supply increases.

Amd,"Is Ray Tracing really that much more GPU intensive than anything before it, or is it still a matter of early, unoptimized software implementations in general terms? (drivers, game engine, directx/vulkan libraries etc)","Playing Resident Evil Village on 4K with most settings maxxed, fps capped at 60, but Ray Tracing off, a 6800XT stays really really quiet/silent almost all the time. Very rarely, maybe not even 10% of the time, the fans get a bit audible but soon go back to imperceptible levels.

Just by enabling Ray Tracing, the 6800XT's fans get immediately very loud and stay that way during the whole game (no matter the scene).

Does anyone have proper knowledge about whether this is expected to change with software optimizations, on the same hardware? Be it either drivers, game engines, or Windows updates.


-----
On a side note.. Apart from the specific places/scenes widely used to showcase raytracing in this game, honestly I could barely see the differences between Ray Tracing on VS off. And even when I managed to spot the differences, indeed Ray Tracing made some details more ""realistic"" or ""correct"", but not necessarily ""better looking"". For example, in my personal opinion, puddles of water looked better with Ray Tracing off.

So I played the game with Ray Tracing off, and a quiet room.. a much better tradeoff for a horror game imho.",False,183,0,1,0

Amd,5900x first time AMD user - how to make sure temps are ok?,"After 30 years of Intel, this week finally I switched from my 5 yo i7-6700k to AMD Ryzen 5900x. Big step, I know.

My main objectives is keeping fans very silent. However now I am pretty unsure, I installed it correctly.

I paired it with a  NH-D15 [chromax](https://noctua.at/en/chromax).black, a B550-Xe Motherboard and a pretty noise dampened Thermaltake case with 3x140  NF-A14-HS-PWM chromax.black fans.

I applied paste myself all my life. The old CPU 6700k almost never triggered fans, maybe in some games. But I do not play a lot of games, this being a workstation mainly used for work (after effects, premiere and software development). I did not updated GPU and this is still Asus Strix 1070 and judging from market prices I need to keep it still.

So my configuration is:

AMD Ryzen 5900x  
NH-D15 [chromax](https://noctua.at/en/chromax).black (both fans mounted) 2x140mm  
Thermaltake case (noise dampened inside)  
3x140  NF-A14-HS-PWM [chromax.black](https://chromax.black) case fans

So my problem is, is the CPU temp ok? Have I applied ok the thermal paste? How can I make sure?

At idle, or light browsing CPU load is 2-8%, the CPU Package temp is 55-60 C. But as soon as I do something, temp goes up very fast to close to 80C and maybe even few degrees over. It also go down very fast back to 55-60 C, so there is not much thermal inertia.

AFAIK NH-D15 is very potent and I would expect temps to stay under 70 C even under medium loads. Also CPU temp is 10-15 C at least less than package.

Also I would love not to take out the CPU Heatsink to check how well, I applied thermal paste.

So TLDR, is there a way to make sure the thermal paste is best applied from temperatures?",False,48,0,1,0

RTX 3060TI  
32GB Ram at 2666

The new one:  
5800x  
3060Ti  
64GB Ram at 3200

I wanted to upgrade it for Davinci Resolve and other software, of course I will also game on it but that's on a second place.

  
Currently working on a 12minute 4k project. With the old CPU Resolve was running ok but stuttering when trying to play the 4k h264 clips so of course I was working with proxies.  
Now since I reinstalled Windows, I didn't have the proxies anymore and the 5800x can play the clips relatively in real time at 25fps. That's a big plus.

However when trying to go into Fusion it's the same story as with the 6700k, very laggy.

The biggest disappointment is the temperatures. When the CPU starts going and reaches 100% use, the temps go above 80, the highest was 87. I am using a Noctua NH-U14S in idle it sits at around 42. On the 6700k I was using a Hyper 212 EVO and the CPU was never going above 74.

The next disappointment is the render time. The project I am working on, took around 10:30 minutes to render with the 6700k. With the 5800x it actually takes the same time or closer to 11minutes. I was hoping render time to be cut at least in half compared to a 5 years old CPU.

- Take Screenshot: Ctrl + Shift + I - This is ""Inspect Element in most web browsers, aside from Chrome where it's Ctrl + Shift + J (Save Instant GIF)

- Push To Talk: Mouse Middle - This is more of a personal one since I use this but I don't know anyone else who uses this, but this toggles Auto-Scrolling.

- Toggle Performance Overlay: Ctrl + Shift + O: This opens the bookmarks manager for most Chromium-based browsers and can also be ""Open File"" for some programs (e.g: qBittorrent has this as ""Add Torrent Link &amp; Adobe Illustrator has this as ""Create Outline)

- Toggle Radeon Chill: F11 - This is fullscreen for a ton of programs.

Amd,"If your GPU is on it's deathbed, undervolt it - a tale of an RX 580 Owner","I have owned a RX 580 for a bit over 2 and a half years, and since then it's board partner design cooler   has caused me nothing but trouble, as the temperatures would easily climb into the high 80's as the cooler ramped up into hyperspeed.

Several solutions have been tried, with fan curve tuning, liquid metal repasting and opening the case to remove a case cooling bottleneck that could exist, but that did not fix the fundamental problem, that the cooler attached to my card was simply not designed to cool it's 150W package.

I like my RX 580 (Would like it even more if I had been able to get one at a reasonable price) but when you boil it down, it is just AMD trying to make use of their polaris stock by putting more juice into them. Not an intrinsically bad idea, but it seems that my cards manufacturers did not really factor this into their design (or lack thereof)

Over the past few months I have somewhat touched upon undervolting, applying a -50-100mv core volage in msi afterburner, this would yield lower power consumption but would sadly lead to crashes, so a few days ago I searched for RX 580 undervolting on the web and got to work. 

And over the course of 3 days I lost ≅ 50W of power from my GPU core, this has led to an 11% drop in performance, but also a 10-15 °C drop in temperatures. 

What managed to keep my gpu stable as I turned down the core clock by 165 mhz and 200 mv was careful lowering of the voltage graph at it's p-state points. I closely followed the stock power graph in my settings, and one test after another I was astonished as the power consumption, voltage, temperature and noise went down without a single crash all the way to -220 mv, where the gpu began behaving somewhat strangely.

You can access these controls in Radeon Wattman, but  lieu of that I used MSI Afterburner, &gt;!since Radeon settings is still (In 2021) barely functional, and did not even launch for me when I tried to check it while writing this post.!&lt; You can access the controls by pressing ctrl+F or clicking the 3 bard left of the core clock slider. (make sure to apply in the main afterburner window after you change it)

I ran over a dozen stable tests but here's the ones I bothered to write down. For fairness I used my cards auto fan profile on all of them, though I use a custom one.

    unigine superposition 1080p medium
    Run 1 - 6544 - 1200 mhz p3 -115mv p4 -160mv p5-7 -180mv - max 72-73 °C
run 2 - 7337 - stock - Max 86 °C
run 3 - 6549 - 1200 mhz p3 -130mv p4 -175mv p5-7 -200mv - max 70 °C
run 4 - 6351 - 1200 mhz p3 -140mv p4 -200mv p5-7 -220mv - max 70 °C

This morning I reverted back to stock settings for a minute and immediately I heard the fans ramp up and the capacitors squealing, I recommend trying to see how much you can lower the voltage without touching the core speed, I just lowered mine just to try to extend the lifespan of my card as much as possible (I want to pass this down to my younger siblings later and I would like for it to last even in a poorly maintained case)

As blistering hot 25 °C heat encroaches Europe, having a space heater on your desk is not the most fun thing, so being able to lower the wattage by a third makes a perceptible difference in being able to be in the room.

Good luck and may affordable GPU's come back some day.",False,102,0,1,0

Is this known to only effect chips manufactured at a certain period or thr launch chips or could it just be any random chips.

Currently, I'm using a R5 2600X combined with a ZOTAC RTX 2060 with 16GB RAM running at 3000MHz. However, somehow I've been having a lot of encoding overloaded errors in OBS, (I'm using NVENC (new)) even after lowering my bitrate, my encoding preset to Quality, and running OBS in admin mode. My ingame settings were also lowered to the minimum so I don't stress out my resources, but this shit error keeps on appearing. 

So I've been scouting a new setup, so far I've shortlisted a R7 3800X and RX6700XT. Now I know I'll be missing out on my GPU encoding option, but I think the x264 encoding should be able to take the brunt of it given that it's a 3800X.

Summary:

* Single digit better performance than comparable Ryzen 5000H
* But power consumption is much higher (which is critical to gaming laptops where total power budget is capped)
* Media encode performance worse than 11xxG7 (TGL-U) due to only one group of MFX/SFC where 11xxG7 has two groups
* DDR-3200 default to gear down mode (memory controller run at half speed)

So my questions are Can I OVERCLOCK and UNDERVOLT at the same time? If I have a undervolt profile in my bios, does RM override this or will it use the auto OC in conjunction with the undervolt profile in my bios? I use this rig for gaming and casual desktop work... Word, web browsing...

Amd,"USB dropout still persistent using a Ryzen 7 Pro 4750G with a MSI B550M Mortar WiFi, Others using similar rigs, Any luck on your end?","So, AMD releasing the Agesa [1.2.0.2](https://1.2.0.2) seems to be hit or miss for a lotta people (Sadly a miss on my end)  I noticed when it comes to the USB drop out issues however I legitimately wonder when AMD will address the issue (or know about it still not working for some people) for people using a 4000G APU. I so far tried every known combination of fixes/work around and every bios version that is supported for my APU and none so far seems to fix the issue. I wonder if anyone else with a similar setup has had any luck with this because I am starting to lose faith due to the lack of support it seems, I did contact AMD support previously and submitted a bug report using the tool but only was told to change my PCIe Gen to Gen 3 rather than Gen 4 (Despite my APU not supporting Gen 4 in the first place lol) and to disable C states  (which I did already) and never got a reply past that even tho I explained I tried those fixes and such in the first and reply posts.   


So my question really is if there is still work being done to address the issue in the background of things or if there is just going to be an issue that persists for months or years since I practically am stuck using the USB C port on my GPU with a powered USB hub for everything which is incredibly disappointing for a system I paid a good bit for and the impressions I got going with AMD for the first time since 2012 and the non existent support help being about the same as getting a response from a human on Steam support  


List of things I have tried so far:  
Disabling C-states  
Disabling Spread Spectrum  
Full stock Bios  
Updating the bios  
Trying every other bios version supported by my motherboard  
Messing with VDDP/SOC voltages  
Messing with CPU and IGPU Voltages  
Using Linux  
Underclocking my CPU  
Ram at XMP and Jedec timings  
Disabling Wifi+Bluetooth, Audio, and LAN  
Using different sticks of ram  
Changing IF timings and voltages  
Disabling CSM (never used it since it uses UEFI only by default)  
Disabling XHCI Handoff  
Disabling Legacy USB support  
Setting PCIe Slots to Gen 1/2/3  
Using and not using Chipset drivers  
Changing Power plans  
Disabling windows USB Power Savings  
Swapping PSUs (tried 4 different ones I own)  
Using different GPUs (Tried a 2070 super, 3 Different GTX 970s, HD 6850, HD 7570, and a GT 710)  
Using only the IGPU  
Using a Usb hub  


Also my APU I have checked and it was made in the second week of 2021.

Things I haven't tried is trying to use a different CPU as I do not have the money to be able to get a 5800x let alone a different CPU that supports the motherboard at the current moment, that is the only thing I legitimately have not tried, but apart from that, nothing works so yea. Basically giving up and considering on getting a intel based board and CPU if the issue isn't fixed in the upcoming months and the support I been getting being entirely disappointing at best.  


Video proof on my dropout issue:

Amd,Should I upgrade from my 2700x to a 5800x?,"Hello all, the main question is in the title.   


For more details, here is my build.

Ryzen 7 2700x

EVGA RTX 3080 FTW3

G.Skill Trident Z 4x8 GB 3600 mhz

Asus Prime B450+

&amp;#x200B;

I play on a 27"" 1440p 144hz monitor.

At times I feel like the CPU struggles in games, and I have seen the comparison videos. Would you upgrade your CPU? If so, would you also get a new motherboard?

&amp;#x200B;

The big reason I am hesitant is knowing that it is already May, and new CPUs are right around the corner that are rumored (aren't they always?) to have large year-over-year improvements thanks to the 5 nm manufacturing process. However, from my understanding, it would be a DDR5 chipset, which would likely require me to buy both a new motherboard and ram, which I imagine will be $$$.

Amd,"I spent a year trying to fix my 5600 XT Pulse via drivers, new PSU, underclocking, better cooling, etc. It was faulty hardware, completely died, and it's too late to RMA.","I tried to put all of the relevant information in the title, and I'm feeling so far beyond crushed about the whole situation.

I built a new computer last June/July, thrilled that I had *finally* saved up enough to order a new system that would run games made this decade, manage productivity tasks quickly enough to not make me pull my hair out, and last me another 5-10 years. I also moved, immediately after, to a place where shipping to/from Amazon isn't really viable, and life circumstances left me unable to use the system for about 4 to 5 months.

Almost right from the start, stress tests, games, and even some light browsing would quickly result in a combination of artifacting, freezing, and eventually crashing, all with the sounds still playing.

I started by making sure it wasn't my power supply, and that everything ran faultlessly with my old GPU installed.

So, given the state of AMD's drivers at the time (or at least the prevailing sentiment about them on Reddit), I assumed it was a driver issue. 

With a fully default setting mobo BIOS (and retried with every single update since), I've spent hours upon hours trying every possible driver (as the full Adrenalin installation and as just the driver itself, even before minimal installation was an option in the installer), and every combination of settings. No luck.

I tried setting all fans to maximum, and keeping my room cooler. No luck.

I tried going into Adrenalin advanced performance settings, and - after many hours of researching what I was doing, to ensure no mistakes - I went about underclocking the card, hoping that maybe stressing it as minimally as possible would at least result in it being useable at all. This, combined with maximum fans, kept it working for *some* games, sometimes, if they were set to bare minimum settings. I *still* attributed the rare crash to driver instability, and would go through the multi-hour ""diagnostic"" process, every time.

As of yesterday, the card finally gave up the ghost. A few seconds after booting to desktop, it artifacted, and the display output completely and permanently died.

Delving deep into yet more troubleshooting forums and posts, it seems stupidly obvious - my card was faulty straight off the factory production line. (Something about VRAM?)

Is there anything I can possibly do in my situation? I can't do my work and productivity tasks entirely on my phone, there's no way I'll be able to buy a replacement GPU this year, even at MSRP, and I think I'm completely out of luck on an exchange/RMA.",False,22,0,1,0

At least when it comes down to FS2020 I can definitely feel my PC struggle with it, probably due to the 3440x1440 resolution, but most other games seem stable around 70-90 fps.

Amd,"AMD, either do something to fix Relive or remove it from your software.","TLDR: Relive has many inconsistencies and they're far from ever being acknowledged. 

&amp;#x200B;

You know those posts you see of ""Day X of me trying to get them to read this post"" or any of those other silly fads? Yeah well, this feels like that.

&amp;#x200B;

I've used Experience, I've used Relive, I've used OBS, I've used all the common recording software one might use but even as a backup, Relive just doesn't need to be in the software.  It's very inconsistent and I'm tired of going through clips to realize it recording a green screen, didn't record, doesn't think it's running, wants to be toggled off and on,  ""can't use certain settings"" (this one was a claimed bug fix to something that wasn't tested and didn't fix anything), of it thinking I'm watching copyright protected content because one of my Netflix windows stayed paused in the background, and now garbled, unwatchable recordings.  The software names everything ""Unknown"" throws it in a new folder it made up. Some of these bugs have persisted through a dead 5700XT to a replacement for anybody that wants to claim hardware.

These bugs have persisted through DDUs, Windows resets, and full blown formats. I don't run garbage in the background... not even RGB software. Yet, I write a full bug report about how I get unusable clips that are nothing but a green screen and audio and your mention in the known issue is ""some thumbnails are green.""  

&amp;#x200B;

So to celebrate my frustration with Radeon software, I'm going to show off a really nice tap Frenzy 4k in Valorant I had. Keep in mind, the only reason Relive had this was because I forgot to run OBS.  Yes, that's my fault to forget to run the software, but I'm not even using Relive primarily.   When I run OBS I don't even allow it to touch the weak AMD encoder because other than the awful quality it has, I'm told by AMD not to use the better h265 option even though that's not the cause of all the issues and I don't want there to be ANY confliction between recording with OBS and AMD.  When I used AMD's encoder with OBS, I've never once had any of the issues I have with Relive.  

*Processing video 3gs7xfqnacy61...*

See AMD? That's not a thumbnail that's green.  It's the entire clip.  I hope this demonstration stresses how bad it is.

In the last 100 or so clips I have, I've counted around 18 green screen recordings where the clips are completely gone and 2 completely corrupted ones.   This post is mostly to vent because this has been having all kinds of issues for months and months and I keep reporting it and there's no acknowledgement.  I'm the target audience that uses your software and I hate it. It feels very untested and I'm sick of losing fun clips because nobody cares to fix it.   

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I don't like being an asshole, I just want this to work consistently or to at the very least acknowledge the problem at hand. I get there is more standard software for a reason but the fact that this can't even be used as a backup feels VERY low effort. I encourage people to use it more to experience these bugs to push them to better their own products and services to at least a standard of working.",False,47,0,1,0

Amd,I only started getting the infamous idle / low power random reboots after updating my Windows 10. So I thought I would just add this info here to try and help eliminating this issue.,"&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: Ryzen 5950x / x570 chipset; with PBO on -16 all cores, +150MHz limit. Radeon 6800XT. Latest AMD chipset drivers, latest Radeon drivers. Never had idle / low power reboots, but started getting them after finally updating Windows (after several months without updating it). I can play a heavy game for hours without a crash, but then a few minutes after exiting it and working on desktop, will sometimes get a reboot.**

\--------------------

I use my PC for work a lot, so usually I completely block Windows Update, and only do it manually once or twice a year. (I try to keep it stable).

Until recently, last time I had updated Windows was several months ago. And for the past several weeks, I was using it without any problems like freezes or reboots.

On my spare time I was playing a lot of Witcher 3 on 4K and never had a single crash or reboot neither during heavy load, nor idle on Windows/desktop or under light load.

Specs are Ryzen 5950x, X570 chipset, 6800XT, PCI-E 4.0 SSD, and 3200MHz RAM (set through XMP or whatever it's called). PBO -16 on all cores, +150MHz max.

Recently I got Resident Evil Village, and after noticing that I could not activate Ray Tracing in the game options, I found out that it was due to not having the latest Windows Updates (and thus, the latest version of DirectX 12). So I unblocked Windows Update, updated the system completely (rebooted a few times and updated again until no more updates were available). (Then I blocked Windows Update once more).

I got random reboots a couple of times on desktop under light load, so I completelly uninstalled and wiped the traces of the AMD chipset drivers and reinstalled all of them at default options. Still get random reboots, especially after playing a game for some time and then exiting to desktop and using it for a couple of minutes. The reboots are always instant, no errors are displayed. The PC just freezes for a second or two then reboots.

Like I said, it only started after I fully updated Windows. But I am not 100% sure if it is related to the CPU or the GPU.

I am aware that the problem is related to hardware, voltage etc. But maybe the way Windows handles internally the hardware/voltage relationship (and maybe the other system components) has changed after the update?",False,33,0,1,0

basically, the issue is that everything, always, has microstutters like the refresh rate is wrong or something. which i think i have confirmed becuase if i go to [this](https://www.vsynctester.com/) with any browser i get flickering 'vsync' in the [box as the image itself has the same microsutter](https://i.imgur.com/WMBFS8S.jpg). there are a couple games i've gotten running smoothly, path of exile, wotlk wow client, and a couple others, but  most games will read as having high fps even as they also have this same infuriating microstutter. it is extremely bad when trying to watch any kind of video. strange thing is it will often look good for scenes with tons of action and motion, but as soon as the camera pans it becomes extremely evident. even scrolling webpages shows this same stutter, and even tears. but movies and especially cartoons are literally painful to look at. whether streaming online, downlowded and in a player, or even test video in windows HD color settings, and that one runs even worse than most other video. although the amd windmill test looks fantastic, perfectly smooth.

i have tried different cables. different refresh rates in my monitor settings. i have disabled HDCP. i have disabled adaptive sync, tried with vsync forced on or off. ive tried with freesync enabled and disabled. i have searched extensively online, i have posted numerous times asking for help on this, and still have no clue what the issue is or how to fix it. certainly cant afford new hardware sadly. what drove me to make yet another post was downloading a show in 1080p, which looks fantastic as a still image, but is literally unwatchable when running it is so stuttery. looks worse than a tv from the 90s.

ive posted on this on numerous tech sites i havent gotten a useful answer. im at my wit's end... please tell me one of ya has this and found a simple solution i have managed to overlook in all this time. always the same things over and over; update drivers, run DDU, update windows, blah blah blah. ive tried all the standard things. all i can think of at this point is a stupid default setting somewhere that causes this, or faulty hardware. and if it is hardware i have no idea what.",False,1,0,1,0

Anyway this will be my first AMD GPU and I'm just wondering if there are any common tips out there regarding things such as the Radeon control panel, etc. I'm only familiar with NVIDIA. Also, apparently Radeon Crimson has both fan tuning and overclocking support, is this true? Currently I use MSI Afterburner to control my fan curve on my GPU. If I could just use AMD's drivers that would be great.

Another random question that I can't seem to find a concrete answer on; will a g-sync monitor work with an AMD GPU? As in, will I be able to enable variable refresh rate somehow?

Amd,Confirmed: the 5950X works with the older Asus ROG X470-F motherboard,"Happy to say that my older X470 board seems to handle the 5950X just fine using BIOS 5843 that came out about a month ago.  Interestingly, this BIOS seems to have lost the ability to download BIOS images over the network.  Maybe that feature was a casualty of Asus adding support for Zen-3?

Running Linux so I can't run any of the standard benchmarks typically posted here.  Not sure if Linux frequency-reporting is accurate but so far all-core boost seems to stop at 4.5ghz when running something simulations on all cores.  If only a few threads are used, they seem to boost to a little under 4.9.  I'm guessing that Linux is interpreting the temperature sensors incorrectly because full-load temps seem to peak around 68C (they'd hover between 74C and 78C on my 2700X).  Cooling is via a DR4 Pro HSF.

I'm really curious to see whether the X470-F will now be able to run my memory better than my 2700X could.  I have 4 sticks of Patriot B-die rated for 4000 but my 2700X couldn't run better than 3200c14.  Won't be able to play with that until next weekend.",False,14,0,1,0

AMD Wi-Fi 6E wireless networking module, debuts at AYANEO!!!

------AMD Wi-Fi 6E wireless networking module, debuts at AYANEO with the most powerful network performance------

In the past update, we mentioned that the revised PCBA will use AMD's wireless networking module, many people are saying that AMD didn't launch the wireless networking module, and some even think I'm cheating people. It's like every update in the past, some people are skeptical. I'm very sincere in updating the progress and sharing ideas, there are always people who don't trust me. But it doesn't matter, most of the supporters can see my work, support me and encourage me, which makes the hard work worthwhile.

Today's update officially announces to all that the AMD Wi-Fi 6E module is making its debut on the AYANEO, and we will be using AMD's never-before-announced Wi-Fi 6E wireless network module RZ608 on the second batch of 2,000 AYANEO handhelds backed on Indiegogo, and become the game handheld with the strongest network performance at present.

https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620580511/km1mwurmwo4rx0p656iw.png

Many brands are not as advanced as AYANEO, and our cooperation with AMD allows us to be the first to get the latest CPU and technical support among handheld consoles. The RZ608 announced today has never been revealed on the Internet, so many of you don't believe it. We may be the first to use this module on the AYANEO, providing AYANEO users with enhanced performance, both for gameplay and for smooth web surfing.

Wi-Fi 6E is an upgraded version of Wi-Fi 6. Wi-Fi 6E makes 4 main technical improvements compared to Wi-Fi 6:

    Adding 6GHz frequency band to improve network experience; Capacity increase;
    Breakthrough in speed;
    Lower time delay.

Importantly, Wi-Fi 6E is a good solution to the problem of overcrowding in the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, after all, there are more and more wireless devices at home now. If 6GHz is available, devices with high network requirements can connect to this band.

In addition to Wi-Fi 6E, the RZ608 module also supports Bluetooth 5.2 technology, which provides faster connection speed, lower latency, faster transmission speed, longer distance, lower power consumption, and better user experience compared to Bluetooth 5.0, providing you a better experience to connect Bluetooth devices on AYANEO.",False,1,0,1,0

I was trying to get a RTX3080 and did everything possible but couldn't. I just watched prices go up like crazy and in my country Egypt, even lowest models of RTX 3080 are sold for like 32K EGP and OC models for up to 36K EGP ($200 to $2300).

Amazon Japan had a few GPUs that could be ordered but all were Temporary Out Of Stock so I placed orders for them since February. RTX3080, RTX3070, RX6800XT and RX6900XT.

Many orders got cancelled because Amazon couldn't get stock and others are delayed with no due date.

For my surprise, Amazon sent an email saying that the Power Color AMD Radeon RX6900XT Red Devil will be available and due to May 12th delivery.

I decided to pay for it and received it yesterday. Total price with shipping and customs was a bit less than 22K EGP ($1400) so I guess it was a great deal.

Note: My PC is ancient xD I am so glad the GPU worked fine with it.

Amd,Huge piece of advice for Ryzen 5000 series CPUs from a fellow Ryzen 5000 owner,"I have built 2 systems with Ryzen 5000 CPUs and have noticed 1 thing that dramatically reduces temperatures. For both systems on stock motherboard settings, the Ryzen 5000s would idle at temps between 45-50 degrees and maxing at around 75-80 degrees (one of which being cooled by an AIO cooler). After fooling around with thermal paste, and AIO positioning to no avail I finally found my solution, undervolting. 

I'm not sure if this a an ASUS motherboard issue since both of the Ryzen 5000 builds have been on ROG builds, but I still want to share this regardless. At stock settings, AM4 ASUS motherboards give about 1.45V of power to a CPU socket. This, as of now, causes Ryzen 5000 series chips to significantly overheat. Just by bringing my CPU voltage to 1.25V, my 5800x is currently idling at 28-33 degrees instead of the 45-50 degrees it was before. 

So in the future if you ever find yourself in a position where your CPU is just running way too hot, give undervolting a try! It also cannot harm the CPU since you are in no way damaging it, you are just giving it less power.",False,10,0,1,0

Amd,HP Omen 30L Ryzen 7 5800x - Undervolting without BIOS option,"Hi, so I recently bought a HP Omen 30L from Best Buy in a split decision to upgrade from my old system. It was a good deal but i knew certain customizable options would be obsolete. It is a solid build and i do like this pc.

Specs:

HP Omen 30L GT13-1094

Ryzen 7 5800x

RTX 3060 TI FE

32gb Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro(Omen's Hub Turbo'd to 3467MT/s)

120mm CoolerMaster AIO(HP Omen edition)

HP 650w PSU

M.2 1000g

2x 1000g SSD's

I am going to discuss how i performed undervolting, achieving lower CPU temps. 

First, i turned on my pc and installed all the updated drivers. CPU, BIOS, Win10, Nvidia, MSI afterburner, AMD Ryzen Master, Etc. I then had friends playing a game so i jumped in ready for the frames to hit my face like a gust of wind... PC started sounding like a jet engine and i could see CPU temps at 90c. 

Immediately shut off and applied new Thermaltake TG-8 thermal paste.. No difference in temps. 

So I started researching and learned of the 5800x overvoltage issues when all HP gives you is a 120mm Coolermaster AIO. This AIO is not enough cooling and upgrading this is not of interest(time/lazy). I wanted this system to work and i believe i have found the way. 

Default CPU settings would have my voltage at 1.35-1.4 at boost clocks of 4.8ghz. So i started undervolting my system. Not the normal way though as my BIOS is completely locked and has no advanced options to change voltage, curve optimizer, voltage offset, etc. The only way to change voltage or clock speed was by using Omen Gaming Hub and Ryzen Master. 

Using Omen Hub i lowered the voltage with 4.4ghz clock(multicore) until it was instable, running Cinebench R20 a few times with each change. First failure was at 1.075 peak core voltage. 1.08125 has been stable for a multitude of tests inside games, C r20, ryzen master stress test. 

Stats, Cinebench R20 score. Note, can not change fan speeds either so all default settings as well :(.

At default CPU settings in RM = 5614-5627 mc. Single core I did not test as temps were 90c as soon as i started the test in multicore and moved on to undervolting asap. 

At 1.08125v 4400mhz all core = 5727-5780 at 77-78c. 

1.08125v 4400mhz all core Single core = 562, 563 at \~65-66c. 

PBO in Ryzen Master went to 90c immediately with score of 5633 (thermal throttling speed at 4.3ghz).

At 1.15v 4400mhz all core = 5750-5815(only once) avg 5780. but at 80-82c. 

So i think i have found MY solution, 1.08125v all core at 4.4ghz is stable, max 80c, and in games \~72-75c. Idle temps of 52-54c. With 80c seeming to be the degrees where my fans would kick up a few notches and become to audible, i wanted to stay under 80c. Yes my scores are lower than they should but it beats spending $450 for a new Mobo, PSU, and cooler and case. 

I have now bought Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut and Noctua Chromax replacement fans for the pump and rear exhaust. I've also added one old case fan as an intake at the bottom of my case. 

...

Thank you for all who have made posts regarding this CPU and their findings, without your help i would have sent this sucker back. LOL. 

I still feel the itch to get better temps so maybe someday i will cough up the extra coin and custom build another PC with this CPU/GPU. 

...

Questions for Reddit, 

Should i use Ryzen master or Omen software for this manual clock setting?? Using Omen for now. Is there a better option as it kind of an hassle to to reapply my settings each time i turn on my pc. 

At 1.08125v and 4.4ghz i am using EDC 140.6A(74% of 190A) constantly when running Cinebench R20. According to AMD 140A is the max current allowed. Any issues with that?

...

Thank you again. 

TLDR: 1.08125v at 4400mhz gave me comfortable temps and score.",False,43,0,1,0

I've seen noticeable performance improvements in a few games a week in with Kingdom Come Deliverance being one of them and my Time Spy graphical score went from 19110 to 20358. Even the Auto OC in Radeon Software overclocks gpu to 2620mhz from 2472. I only have the demo of 3D Mark and just recently got into tweaking. I built my first pc a year and a half ago so this is quite exciting.

MSI  have failed undoubtedly failed to refund my laptop amount \[1.40 lakh= 1,911.15 $ \].  They are being so irresponsible on my refund. Instead they are asking me to go to the police station.

As per they asked me to contact Hemachandra\[reddington\] and Dinesh \[Isystems\] - I have contacted several tie and it has not resolved my issue. Hemachandra sent me an email that he has cleared the amount to the dealer and his part is over, Then I again contacted the dealer Dinesh to transfer the money, Dinesh has changed multiple dates and failed to transfer the money,thus MSI. Here I don’t know who is holding the money and why. As per MSI assured me about the refund, it should happen during august 2020, But is delayed for more than 12 months. I have tried contacting the customer care, chat help, emailed to MSI India Service &lt;[indiaservicenb@msi.com](mailto:indiaservicenb@msi.com)\&gt; , everybody seems to incompetent to solve my issue. I don’t understand why i should go to the police complaint as a premium customer, instead MSI company has to file a case who responsible for the delay. I need my refund by this week otherwise i have to go for a legal action which will irreversible. So please resolve this issue as soon possible.

On 17 Oct 2019, Time -13:43 Mr. Monsoor Khan called me and informed that the computer is working fine and hinted me that servicing center is separate a unit from MSI team which makes them to take customer supportive decisions. Even for Monsoor it seemed to be a strange case that in 4 days high-end laptop is giving such a glitch just because it’s lacking a driver.

     Now the situation is that, I have faced this problem on the first week of purchase- which is technically deserves a replacement without any second thought according to the nature of the problem. Instead all of you are saying that this is just a driver issue and it is working 100% and if there any problem comes up after 7 days from the date I take this laptop from service center they will support me \[But Monsoor has not suggested the solution –

Is it a replacement or a hardware replacement \[which is coming under one year warranty\]. In short I am going to lose the chance of replacement for this faulty machine which can go wrong even after 7 days and then I would be continued this again to the service center and also will be searching for this ‘unreachable’ MSI team. This gives a sense that I got a second hand quality laptop which can relapse multiple in the first year of purchase which does not make any sense to me. MSI or Service center not giving any assurance on this, instead they are clearing their side by saying this machine is 100% working or no hardware issue.

Let me add you, I don’t know what kind of test you are running.

Secondly, the software like Premiere Pro CC, Resolume Arena, Touchdesigner and games etc. demands a lot of graphic consistency. Here this laptop is giving glitch on all these including a YouTube video, which is optimized universally for most of the players and computers. The driver report I totally understand and consider this as a good thing, But I am not that stupid as the technicians in the servicing center by thinking and noticing these performance below. :-

The MSI STEALTH was running under temperature 60 degree Celsius \[according to the dragon center application\]. This video the glitch can arise again if the temperature goes high during external display options. It happens only a faulty graphic soldering with in the motherboard. So basically, if it is not purely a driver issue it can relapse again and in this unfortunate situation it can be after that 7 days and I will lose my money and computers.

· \[Apple macbook pro 2011 was notorious for this issue and apple have given an extended replacement program\]

· I have seen videos, which MSI having problems with external display issues and Nahimic sound app issues.

· Who will spend 1,62,840/- for a machine with trouble? Why do I buy a problem?

       I am aware that MSI has sent me a ‘driver’ positive 100% working email, which can be a possibility, but they have not sent me an assurance thing than that 7 days. Here already faded the problem with 4 days, which is not considering at all. So I am really confused and disappointed as a premium customer this makes me thinking further legally or filing consumer court complaint and informing media on this situation. I know it will cause some money and effort for me but it should not happen to any one in the near future by not getting correct response from the company.

I wish MSI TEAM would consider this issue seriously to get a deserving solution than changing the motherboard/component \[this is just a warranty thing\].

Also I am asking for 15 days \[non chargeable\] gap to collect the laptop back if no reply on this letter. This is because I have to arrange my stay and travel and also I have to request a leave from my job to reach MSI Bangalore center.

At this juncture, I would like to inform you that the laptop sold to me was a defective one and the same did not serve the very purpose for which I purchased the same. As per the warranty conditions, terms and policies it is your bounden duty to replace the existing defective laptop with a brand new one or in the alternative to reimburse the entire purchase money entrusted with the second among you and as such you all are legally and morally liable to either replace the same in discharge of your legal obligation or to reimburse the entire purchase money.

As I contacted all among you on several occasions via, phone and email communications, l was not offered with a convincing and cogent reply and further all among you failed to cater my need and only offered deaf ears and nelson's eye to my tenable and legitimate request.

The act and conduct from the part of all among you would clearly amount to breach of the contact between me and all among you, thus violating the terms of the guarantee/ warranty.

That, the aforesaid breach of contract and illegal acts committed by all among you are not in keeping with normal course of business or ethical standards and all among you have miserably failed in ensuring customer satisfaction, proper customer care after sales and customer services by selling a most defective good. Further, the acts and conduct from all among you amounts to unfair trade practices by falsely representing that the laptop aforesaid is of a particular standard, quality, quantity, grade, composition, style or Model and further falsely represents that the after sales services are of a particular standard , quality or grade. Further, I would like to inform all among you that, I purchased the aforesaid laptop by believing the representations, advertisement regarding high quality and standard maintained by the first among you but the subsequent acts by all among you amounts to cheating and fraudulent acts.

I affirm and remind you that, I purchased the aforesaid laptop for my own use and the purpose of earning a livelihood by means of self employment and thus being a consumer I am legally and morally entitled to the benefits as contemplated by the terms of the contract between myself and all among you and have every moral and legal right and authority to defend and uphold my valuable rights as a consumer.

Under these circumstances, I do hereby request all among you to do necessary act and things from your part and to genuinely consider my legitimate request to either replace the defective laptop with a brand new one within 7 days from the date of this notice or to reimburse the entire amount of Rs. 1,62,840/- (Rupees One Lakh sixty two eight hundred and twenty Only) with interest at the rate of 12 percent from the purchase date i.e., (13/09/ 2019) till the reimbursement. Further, that I am in no way responsible to pay any rents/fines for those periods during which the defective laptop was in the possession of third among you. If my legitimate and tenable request is not considered, I shall be constrained to initiate appropriate civil/criminal proceedings and shall also approach the fourth pillar of democracy to intimate them regarding the false representations and unfair trade practices committed by all among you and in that eventually all among you shall be held liable for all the costs and consequences arising thereof, without any further reference which you may please note.

Okay. That\\'s a good news for me. I have contacted with the dealer that I bought the machine from, and he forwarded my email copy and DOA certificate to Redington (India). The reddington guy Rajesh said they forwarded to Delhi. I am still waiting for their reply or my refund from MSI. Will you please explain me how the process is complete without getting the money back? Did you mean that the paper work has been done?. I am worried and wanted to confirm this MSI TEAM.

I also love that it's able to record high quality looking video in small file sizes, compared to OBS. But one thing that bothers me is that the separated mic audio is annoying to deal with. It clutters up the folder with all the clips in it, and makes it a pain to go through everything. Along with that, the audio always seems to be slightly out of sync. Even the file length is a few milliseconds longer than the actual video clip. It's just horrible to deal with, but I prefer having separated audio so I can take my voice out of clips that I upload. But sometimes I clip funny conversations, or other moments that only make sense with context, so it's very annoying to deal with then.

But when separate audio tracks are recorded in OBS, it's all saved on the single video file (somehow? i don't really know how it works). You can play back the video on Windows and hear all the separate audio tracks all at once, but when you drop it in Sony Vegas or Premiere, it separates all the audio tracks that it recorded. Everything is perfectly in sync, and it's convenient for both editing and playback from your folder.

So my question is: Why doesn't AMD do this with ReLive? Is there something stopping them from being able to add this? Are they planning on adding this? If so, do they plan on adding more audio tracks to record on?

This would be the one thing that would make me completely quit using OBS for recording videos and whatnot. Plus, it would make it even more convenient for people and save a lot of headaches.",False,1,0,1,0

&gt;I suspect HairWorks does not get a simplified geometry model into the BVH acceleration structure like everything else. It retails the full triangle load within the AS, so each ray has to test against an excessive volume of triangles within a small area of a BVH.

Besides these, it appears that 4A Games did a great job optimizing RT performance on RDNA2 GPUs.

GPU profiling for more info:
&gt;It seems like they are basically doing everything right in terms of RT. Occupancy's very good, TONS of async compute, RT is done with Inline-RT (as far as I can tell right now). It's extremely impressive.

I have been saying that RDNA2 would do well with RT when using DXR1.1, with the feature MS added with AMD collaboration on the new consoles, for inline RT (a more optimized method of casting rays &amp; especially for extra bounces or long ray distance).

This is what 4A Games used to ensure RT performs well for the release of the game on these new RDNA2 consoles.

Yet NV sponsored the Metro series and they obviously snuck in their HairWorks that throws a wrench into the RT pipeline.",False,260,0,1,0

TL;DR at the bottom.

I have a AsRock 5700xt Phantom Gaming GPU. I was having some suddenly unstable overclocks on the memory. I found a product called K5 Pro, a liquid thermal pad replacement, on Amazon. It looked like a perfect solution. 

I took apart my card, measured the gaps on the memory and VRMs and they all appeared to be under 4mm - in spec for the K5. I slapped a jar all over the memory, and power delivery, plus a couple other set of chip banks that had a thermal pad on it. I got everything buttoned up and installed the GPU back in my PC. . . 

Had a picture of the boot screen, but only for a moment. Then everything when to pure shit. System refused to boot. Clear CMOS. No boot. The system was hanging on the ""VGA"" boot sequence light. 

So I went back downstairs and put on more K5 thinking that was the problem, not enough cooling. Still had the issue. Grabbed an old HD 7850 and confirmed all PCIE slots on my machine still worked. 

It was about 1:30 AM at this point, so I just said ""FUCK IT"", ordered replacement 2mm thick thermal pads, more Kryonaut, and called it a night. 

My thought process was that the K5 trapped some moisture somewhere and was causing a short, or it wasn't providing enough cooling. I have no complaints with the product, as I have it in my Lenovo laptop and it provided marked improved results with temps on the hot spots that had thermal pads.

**WHAT I DID TO CLEAN THE CARD**
The K5 is some thicccc boi shit. Like cake frosting, so taking it off wasn't going to be quick. Found a YouTuber from Australia (Tech YES City) who's entire channel was restoring busted GPUs and motherboards. Followed his cleaning path.

* A can of brake cleaner to spray down the card and get the K5 off. It took the whole can to clean the front and back.

* Soaked the GPU in a tub of 99% IPA, using a cheap toothbrush to scrub off the left behind gunk. Left it in the tub while I was at work, came home and let it dry. My logic was any moisture, or shorts caused by potential moisture, would be removed. I got this idea from This Does Not Computer on one of his retro Apple repairs. Any corrosion or moisture that got under any chips would be whisked away. 

* Used a can of Quick Drying Electrical Contact Cleaner a few times to spray down the card. This is my GO TO electronics repair solution, I find it does a better job than IPA. It's saved a few laptops, motherboards, my DJ Mixer, and my water kettle. It does leave a little residue on the GPU die, so I go back with some IPA and a coffee filter to clean the die and the mounting point on the cooler.

At this point I was confident the card was salvageable. I received my replacement thermal pads (after fighting with USPS for three days because the mail carrier couldn't find the front door to my business, while the other two USPS carriers I see every day could). 

Ran home and did one final spray with Contact Cleaner and began measuring and cutting the thermal pads. More Kryonaut and buttoned it all up. Plugged it in. . . Time for the moment of truth. 

***I GOT A FUCKING SIGNAL***

After a week of dread and anxiety, I had fixed the GPU! I was screaming ""I DID IT! I DID IT!"" - I may have scared the cat. 

I cleared the drivers and installed the 5/6/21 update. HWinfo all seemed to be reporting everything okie dokie. SO, I fired up Forza Horizon 4 to do the benchmark...

***HARD CRASH - SYSTEM SHUTDOWN***

All the wind fell out of my sails instantly. Reboot. Crash again on Forza.

Fired up FurMark and HWinfo to watch how things were going. Instantly ramping up to 88C, and the Junction/Hotspot temp was running up to 110C-114C. I was devastated. Thinking I had it, then more issues arrived. 

Took apart the card and added more Kryonaut, spread it around to the edges. Same temps and issues. I thought my pads must not be on right, so I took everything off and instead of cutting rectangles, measured and cut squares for each component. Slapped everything back together and put it in the system. Same error. 

At this point it was 1:30 AM again and I was dead from the neck up. So sad. Let down by my hubris. I had damaged my 5700xt I got for retail over a year ago, and was facing either no GPU or paying $1,700 for a 6800xt. So pissed.

**THEN I NOTICED**

I was staring at the PCB and realized that the thermal past on the GPU die wasn't even, and hardly any squirted out to the sides. I knew this MEANT something, but I was so brain dead I couldn't get things to click. My Dad was being as empathetic as possible (I live in my Dads hangar keeping an eye on the hangar park, and he stays with me in the summer when he has students - this is important), asking questions and trying to help. I kept mentioning the weird looking thermal paste, and that I couldn't figure out what it meant. Then, I had a last ditch hail marry idea...

**IN COMES GAMERS NEXUS**

I remember seeing some vidz from GamersNexus and JayzTwoCents about the reference 5700xt having mounting pressure issues, and that the Junction/Hotspot for this card was going up to 110C. The solution? A 1mm thick washer under the GPU cooler mounting screws. 

""Dad, do you have any tiny 1mm thick washers?""
'No, I don't think I have anything like that. Nothing that small'
""Are you sure? Plastic, or nylon?""
'No, nothing that small'
""Dad, look at all this shit you refuse to throw away *gestures at hangar* I call bullshit""

So my Dad wanders off and comes back with a tiny set of drawers, like a tacklebox, that looked to be older than me - from mid 80's.

'I might have something in here, but I don't know'

**Wonderous Washer wRoundup**

This mother fucker had stacks of tiny washers, all measured at 1mm thick. I grabbed four brass ones, checked for any SMDs that may interfere with them, and screwed them down. I had never recalled screwing the cooler down this tight before, and I was worried I was gonna shatter the die or snap the PCB. 

I got the back plate back on and triple checked all the screws holding the cooler down. 

My Dad asked
'So, what is this gonna do?'
""It's going to increase the mounting pressure on the die, which may help with cooling""
'Ok, but I don't understand how it's going to work'
""Well, Dad, frankly...I don't either but this guy has over a million subs on youtube, and has a 30 minute video saying that it will work. So fuck it why not""

I went back upstairs and put the card back in the machine. Booted it up and went into FurMark

**68C Stock Settings**

WHAT THE FUCK IT FUCKING WORKED SHIT MY ASS!

We were both dumbfounded. I went from 112C with thermal throttle, to a cool 68C on the Junction/Hotspot, stable clock speed. This was COLDER than I remember running before when I got the card new out of the box. 

I put my normal overclock on the card, and tested it on FurMark. 78C. 

I said ""Fuck it, why not"" and maxed the clock speed out in Adrenalin, undervolted to 1100mv, and went balls to the wall on the memory speed overclock. I have never pushed this card this far before. It would be instant crash. 

**88C Max Overclock; Stable**

Well fucking hell man. I literally cannot believe the state of this thing. 

The GPU was running COOLER and better than before, and it has me completely dumbfounded. I'm excited to throw the whole system back together and play some PC games. It's been to long. 

Hopefully my wild ride was informative or helps someone in the future. I think a combination of new thermal pads of good quality, and proper mounting pressure helped my GPU out.

Thank you for your time.

Amd,Mod /u/InvincibleBird has been spamming the subreddit with rule breaking posts and refuses to remove them.,"I don't think I have to explain that MLID has a terrible reputation for leaks and false rumors.  His rumor videos are in direct violation of Rule 6.

&gt;**Rule 6:** No unsubstantiated rumors - rumors or other claims/information not directly from reputable sources must have evidence to support them. Any rumor or claim that is just a statement from an unknown source containing no supporting evidence will be removed.

Apparently that rule doesn't apply to the mod team though, as you can see from the searches below /u/InvincibleBird has been abusing his moderator privileges to post MLID videos.  In fact, most of the posts of their content come from /u/InvincibleBird.  Especially the ones tagged as rumor.

https://old.reddit.com/r/Amd/search?q=moore+law+is+dead&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all

MLID rumor/leak videos break rule 6 by definition.  He is not a reputable source, he frequently has ""leaks"" that are proven to be wrong and does not provide any evidence or sources for the bullshit he makes up.  It's quite apparent from these searches that the general consensus, of this subreddit at least, is that MLID is not reputable.

The moderators need to step up and enforce these rules equitably.  Unsubstantiated rumors, regardless of source, should be removed.  Just because a mod is a fanboy of some youtuber that makes up rumors doesn't mean they should get to break the rules to post their content to the subreddit. If the moderators are going to continue to allow posts like this they need to define reputable in rule 6 to reflect that it means things they like can be posted regardless of their actual reputation.

Amd,RIS and Fidelity FX CAS,"Ok.. this might be a stupid question, but it's because AMD just won't standardize their nomenclature, so I gotta ask it.

From what I understand, Radeon Image Sharpening (RIS) is actually Fidelity FX CAS.

Now, whether it is or not isn't really the topic of this discussion, but feel free to correct my assumption if it is not.

The real question I have is... If the game I'm running has Fidelity FX CAS built into the engine (Death Stranding), should I have RIS enabled in Adrenaline or not?

 If it is enabled in both the game and in Adrenaline, do the textures get processed through it twice, resulting in a performance hit, or driver timeouts?

If so, is it better to disable it in game and enable it in Adrenaline, or vice versa?

I'm having a maddening time trying to figure out why Death Stranding is giving me constant driver timeouts on my 6700 XT, and I can't pin it down.

I've done DDU cleanup, factory reset install, turned off freesync, turned off Surface format optimization... Can't stop it from crashing.

Maybe I am not using the more power tool mod correctly as others have state that they were able to hit higher clocks, but I do have some good news. Although I was not able to hit a higher max boost the card did have higher actual clock speeds while under max stress loads like occt. I run the card at a max boost of 2450 mhz. When I ran occt on thermal paste and no more power tool I would see a max actual clock of 21 to 2200 mhz. With the mod I am able to hit 2350 mhz with a consistent power usage of 260w. I used thermal right pads on the vram and was able to get 2150mhz with fast timings running. I saw improvements over 2100mhz in time spy and fire strike extreme benchmarks. If anyone else has a different experience please let me know, but from what I have seen using more power tool and getting the card cooler does help with the actual clocks when running high power loads, but light power loads that hit the max boost clock are based on the silicon lottery.",False,17,0,1,0

So feeling lazy to remove cpu and gpu went with  bios f11 and flashed it via Q-Flash . After orange led blinking over , the motherboard rebooted and gave me a display out saying it was flashing . After getting display i went to site and downloaded f12 . that also worked . f20 didnt work as it was a new AGESA update  and loaded the backup bios ( f12 ) .

Amd,Difference between Piledriver and Zen cores (talking about performance),"I got in a little argument with my dad over modern CPUs compared to older ones.

He's been kind of stuck in the past and the only CPU's he ever uses are opterons. Now, I want to play and record proper games, an opteron doesn't really fulfill the smooth 60fps experience without stutters and he doesn't want me to spend money on modern systems. He doesn't believe there has been a real difference in performance over the last 8 years as he himself has never needed more.

I told him that there has been quite significant improvements over the years and he just shrugs it off as ""marketing from people who get hyped over small increases in performance"".

Now I want to prove him wrong, but I kind of can't as I don't own a system from past the year 2012 and can't do any comparable benchmarks as the points system from basically any benchmark out there doesn't show scaling in  the real world.

I told him that a 6 core Ryzen processor (Zen+ and up) would easily beat the 12 and 16 core opterons 63xx he uses, he doesn't believe it and I want to have concrete evidence of the speed improvements to prove my statement.

I can't find any comparisons online of people comparing Opteron to Ryzen and I can't find any video rendering benchmarks to compare results.

Sorry if this was long and not to the point.

Amd,Is it possible/reasonable for AMD to manufacture big and small chiplets?,"Let me make it very clear first: The following are just some random thoughts, not a suggestion/leak. I am not familiar with the industry, so there are probably some stupid points, ignoring some important factors. Please feel free to correct me if I am wrong, I hope I can learn something from the discussion. (And this is not relate to the big.LITTLE/Alder Lake-like/heterogeneous architecture.)

Currently there are no 4-core Zen 3 CPU except the OEM-only (at least for now) Ryzen 5300G. Of course one very possible reason is that those Ryzen 5/7/9 CPUs with higher core count are much more profitable. But I also thinks that TSMC's 7nm manufacturing process is quite mature, so the yields are high and there are just not enough chiplets with less thatn 6 cores work. (AMD is probably stocking those chiplets for 4-core Zen 3 CPUs.)

In the future generations of Zen (probably Zen 4), AMD is using more advanced manufacturing process, and my guess is there will be more cores in a chiplet. Otherwise AMD needs to add more chiplets in a CPU to increase core count, which might hurt  performance and increase cost.

Therefore I guess we will see some 12-/16-core chiplets in the future, maybe next year. In that case, since Zen 3 will be an ""old"" architecture, AMD will reuse some Zen 3 chiplets and we will have more 4-core Zen 3 CPUs. And when AMD launch Zen 5, there will be 4-core Zen 4 CPUs.

However, older generation 6-core and 8-core CPUs still have their market, just like the 3600(X) and 3700X/3800X now. If the chiplets have more than 6 cores usable, it'd be a waste to put them into 4-core CPUs.

What I am thinking is, will AMD design two types of chiplets, one big (12/16 cores?) and one small (4/6/8 cores?), small chiplets will have higher yields and AMD doesn't need to waste big chiplets for CPUs with lower core count.

I have no knowledge about the cost of doing this, so I am not sure if producing small chiplets is cost effective. Also there maybe some engineering difficulties to have both big and small chiplets in one CPUs, and not puting them together might affect the flexibility of using small chiplets.",False,13,0,1,0

I have a AMD 6900xt GPU, AMD R9 5900x, Gigabyte Aorus Master Motherboard. For a little background the issue that I am about to describe does not happen until I download the most recent drivers for my GPU. If I have a fresh install of windows the monitor does not have an issue. 

What is happening is my monitor a Gigabyte AORUS FI27Q, is not properly getting identified and is being defaulted to a resolution of 640 x 400p. When I look in AMD Radeon Software The monitor is given a default name and not recognized for what it is. No matter what I have tried I can not do anything or get the monitor to properly be identified or get the proper resolution. I tried different wires, different ports, and I tried different port types as well. The issue only happens with this specific monitor when I use the display port.  I have a secondary monitor that uses a display port and has no issue. 

Like I stated above, This issue only appears after I download the most recent AMD drivers. When I was running on the driver version that was two or so iterations behind, I apologize I am not sure the specific driver name, since I cant find it anymore on AMDs site, I did not have this issue.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking to upgrade my CPU and Motherboard for my almost 10 year old pre-built gaming/art PC (2012).

I'm new/inexperienced in sorting through CPUs, especially Ryzen's, so I'm not exactly sure what a solid upgrade option would be. From what I've researched, my i5-3570k is still a good processor for gaming, (which I don't quite understand how a 9-10 year CPU still is), but that's what is making picking out a Ryzen chip even more confusing.

I understand a GPU upgrade would probably benefit my system more than a CPU/Motherboard upgrade, but with the state and prices of GPUs currently, I plan on waiting to upgrade that when prices come down.

I plan on looking for good used CPUs, rather than buying new at 250-300+, so I'm hoping to get some advice on what chips to look out for and snag when I see it at a low price.

Thanks everyone!

Amd,X570 ITX board supporting ECC?,"I’m hoping to get my 2x32GB KSM32ED8/32ME running with my 5950X. Currently it’s running in a B550I Aorus Pro AX. This was always supposed to be a temporary setup. The main reason to change the board is that I would like to be able to experiment with ECC memory overclocking. On this B550I it only seems to run this memory stable at stock settings. The other main thing is PCIe 4.0 x4 for the secondary M.2, but honestly at this point I think I prefer B550 over X570.

I was under the impression that ASUS would have the best ECC compatibility, perhaps they still do, but the Strix X570-I that I tested last night (which took 3 months to get my hands on!) refuses to POST (yellow memory LED stays lit) with any of the three kinds of ECC UDIMM memory I have on hand: 

32GB Kingston KSM32ED8/32ME modules
16GB Samsung M391A2K43BB1-CRC modules
8GB Super Talent F24EA8GS modules

The BIOS versions tested so far:

- 3001
- 3801

This was unexpected and highly frustrating. I guess I was setting my expectations too high. I’m still willing to continue to test different boards with this 3600X I have on hand until I find the right board to complete this holy grail mini workstation with... I’m not going to tear down the workstation only to have it refuse to post again though, never again. If it turns out impossible to make the dream work I might need to just drop the 5950X into the Dark Hero I have here and give up on ITX, but that would be very sad!

Just wondering if there are any tips or tricks anyone’s got. Maybe there’s some secret way to trick a board into booting up with ECC when it doesn’t seem to want to do it?

I know I can more exhaustively test the rest of the available BIOSes, I just think that because none of these ECC modules worked, maybe they’re simply not including the code for ECC on this particular ITX board...",False,18,0,1,0

Amd,Solved my gpu usage spikes thanks to a 4 year old post,"Can't comment on the original post obviously, so making a new one.

After upgrading my system, (Ryzen 7 5800x, rx590 8gb, gigabyte x570 aorus ultra) I've been getting random 0-100-0 gpu usage spikes while idle, and while gaming had constant back and forth on usage causing stuttering and random lag spikes. After going through countless posts on the issue and getting nowhere I stumbled on a post from u/HagridsNutSack referencing another old post from u/yatogamii with a simple solution.

Go into settings on msi afterburner, turn on ""enable unified gpu usage monitoring"". That's it. And just like that, problems disappeared. Everything is stable, no more lag spikes. This also fixed a huge problem I had with Nioh 2 not being able to run in borderless due to the clock speeds being capped at 400 when not in full screen.

Amd,Water Cooled R7 5800X Running Hot,"Hi!

I replaced my old Sandy Bridge-E system this week with a system based around a 5800X. It is much faster obviously, but it is also running hot. Like, *really* hot.

Running Cinebench R20, the temperature jumped up to 90 C and stayed there. I tried remounting the CPU block (cleaning and applying new thermal paste as well), which made no noticeable difference to me. I've tried enabling PBO(2?) and set an all core undervolt of 5, which reduced my max temps to around 85 C. One thing I've noticed in general is that the temperatures seem to jump around much quicker than what I've seen on my old processors. [This is how quickly the temperature jumps to 85 C, when running R20 with -5 undervolt.](https://i.imgur.com/MK8ovu6.png)

I'm using the same custom loop as I had on my previous system: a Heatkiller IV CPU block, one 280mm radiator in push configuration, and a D5 pump. The only addition is a block for the south bridge, which seems to have a TDP of 11W from what I've read.
This loop could cool my old E5 1650 running at 4.7GHz @ 1.4V, which was pulling over 200W if the sensor readings of that motherboard were accurate.

I did some digging yesterday and found that this processor seems to be running pretty hot, but I'd also like to think that my loop should be able to handle this processor...

TL;DR: My 5800X reaches 90 C immediately under heavy load, with stock settings, despite being water cooled (280mm radiator).

I just had to update the BIOS for the motherboard to work with this CPU. The PC has been running now for a few days and have not experienced any issues.

I was reading that running a high end CPU with a lower end mobo can cause issues with the VRM overheating. Could someone clarify this? I don't really know what a VRM is. Is it true, and how do I monitor it?

So can using a budget mobo with such a high end cpu cause damage to my system or cause it to shorten the lifespan?

Amd,Why are Nvidia gpus selling for more than AMD gpus on a price-change basis?,"Hey peeps, early morning for me, can't seem to fall asleep. I'm not sure where to post my thoughts, so I'm gonna post them here.

I've been seeing 3070s being resold in the 1200-1400 side. I've also seen 6900xt reference gpus being sold for 1400s, 1500s,2000s. I'm stumped on why this is and want to know why. 

Mathematically speaking, buying a 6900xt is cheaper given the massive price increases. 

Let's say I bought one for 1600.(1600 (current)-1000(MSRP))/1000(MSRP)x100= 60% increase from MSRP.

Let's says I buy a non-reference 3070 for 1300, and an estimate in MSRP is uuuh let's say like $580. (1300-580)/580x100= 124% increase in price.

So there's like a 2x increase between a 6900xt and 3070. Financially speaking, when the market stabilizes and more graphics cards are produced, cards will be offered at prices closer to MSRP; in other words, the higher the price percentage increase the more you will lose if you decide to sell during the price adjustment period. 


Someone please give insight into this and why Nvidia cards are selling for so much more than MSRP compared to AMD. Or at least prove me wrong or correct me, I'm always down to learn :)

Snagged a 5900x for a new build for my wife. Got purchase confirmation, card charge confirmation and shipping confirmation with FedEx tracking on Thursday. FedEx tracking showed that it got picked up from Saint Paul MN on Friday with a delivery date of Monday May 3rd.

I checked it Sunday night and noticed that the last update showed it arriving at the Osseo MN facility at 12:10am Saturday morning, but it still showed a delivery date of May 3rd by end of day. Package never shows on Monday so I check the FedEx tracking, the last update was it arriving in Osseo MN Saturday morning, and now the scheduled delivery date was showing as ""pending"". Clearly, my CPU is lost somewhere or was taken.

I go to contact AMD and after 30 minutes of searching, couldn't find any number to call for online order issues, and no customer support chat or ticket form I can fill out, almost as if the only interaction they have for a customer buying direct is the purchase process, and even that requires no human interaction.

I called FedEx and they said they can't do anything unless it still hasn't updated by Wednesday, and even then, they can only start their internal location / investigation. The FedEx guy also mentioned that if they can't find it, I'll need to reach out to AMD to ship another, and AMD will go through their standard insurance claim process to request FedEx to reimburse AMD for the lost product. How does any of this work if AMD offers no way to contact them regarding online order issues? Or, am I just blind abd I missed the process for ""what to do when FedEx loses the very hard to obtain shit that you purchased from us""?

This does not solve the problem by any means but I noticed significant improvements.

TLDR: Use PCIE 4.0 if you aren't already

I recently just rebuilt my computer to have a vertical mount and ran into this same FPS issue everyone else had. I had previously wondered why I wasn't experiencing severe FPS drops until after I bought a new PCIE 3.0 vertical mount for my 6800XT. 

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as I booted up my computer after installing this new mount, I was getting horrible FPS in D2. I thought this was fishy, so I ordered a PCIE 4.0 x16 riser cable to replace it and voila!  No more studdering, solid FPS even on the tangled shore.

&amp;#x200B;

I was pretty skeptical this would fix it so i tried it a couple more times. Swapped back to the 3.0 riser and got 13fps in tangled shore. Swapped to 4.0 and getting 60+.

* Asus Prime X570-Pro ; https://www.asus.com/Motherboards-Components/Motherboards/All-series/PRIME-X570-PRO/techspec/

from the specs :

    AMD Ryzen™ 5000 Series/ 4000 G-Series/ 3000 Series/ 3000 G-Series/ 2000 Series/ 2000 G-Series Desktop Processors :
    4 x USB 3.2 Gen 1 port(s) (4 at back panel, blue, Type-A)

* Gigabyte X570 Aorus Xtreme, this one seem to do Gen 2 on only 2 of the ports, and Gen 1 on the other 2 (but... why ?) : https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/X570-AORUS-XTREME-rev-12/sp#sp

From the specifications :

    Integrated in the CPU: 
    2 x USB 3.2 Gen 2*/Gen 1 Type-A ports (red) on the back panel
    * For AMD Ryzen™ 5000 series processors/3rd Generation AMD Ryzen™ processors only.
    2 x USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports on the back panel

Isn't it very weird that manufacturers would mess with the built-in 3.2 Gen 2 10Gbps lanes, instead of passing them through straight to the connectors ?",False,6,0,1,0

The question is : what would be the best CPU for the NITRO + RX 590 8GB Special Edition in order to completely avoid GPU bottleneck ?

Right now I have I5-4690K and I think it's time to replacing it finally. This means I'll be making a CPU+RAM+MOB purchase. 



I'm from EU and I looked at the prices and I can get the following build:

Item| Cost
---|---
AMD Ryzen PRO APU 4650G | ~198€ / ~ 237$
MSI B550M Pro-VDH Wifi | ~130€ / ~156$
G.Skill Ripjaws KIT DDR4 32GB 3200 CL16 (2x16GB)     F4-3200C16D-32GVK| ~190€ / ~228$
Total | ~518€ / ~ 621$


I can get this 4650g with a cooler and 3y warranty. Or I can also get 4750g for ~298€ / ~ 357$.
Or is something on the Intel size also worth considering ?

Amd,"Future GPU ""street"" prices - 2022 and onwards","With all events happening in the last couple of years and no releases in the very upcoming future, I think it would be fun to discuss about the future prices of graphics cards, assuming the market somehow stabilizes in the not too distant future (perhaps one year from now), since COVID should be over and mining could potentially crash again - albeit no one knows for sure, obviously.

IMO, **once this settles**, we might have to pay the next prices for the GPU tiers:

* Entry-level (RX 6500 XT/3050 Ti) - 250$
* Lower-end midrange (RX 6600 XT) - 350$
* Upper midrange (RX 6700/RTX 3060) - 500$
* Lower high-end (RTX 3070) - 750$
* Upper high-end (RTX 3080) - 1000$
* Lower enthusiast (RTX 3080 Ti) - 1500$
* Uber enthusiast (RTX 3090) - 2000$

The reasons for that being:

* In 2019, midrange cards were already 400$ (RX 5700 XT), high-end 700$ (RTX 2080S) and enthusiast 1200/1500$ (2080 Ti/3090).
* A lot of money has been printed in the last year, which will lead to some inflation - how big that is no one knows as of yet.
* GPUs are becoming more ""multi purposeful"" almost every day.
* Some people might gamble on the crypto-bubble thinking that their cards will be resold for at least the same amount of money 2-3 years later when a new bubble bursts - it's obviously a gamble, but after so many bubbles happening, I assume more people will do it.
* Many gamers didn't upgrade from their older cards until know.
* Tariffs -&gt; in theory it might only affect USA, but I'm pretty sure the folks in Europe, for instance, will just ""adapt"" the new MSRP as well, because why not?
* Corporations want higher margins every time.
* Newer node processes/memory technologies are not getting any cheaper, in fact, on the contrary.
* Scalpers, scalpers, scalpers

I did the UV with Rayzen Master because if something goes wrong, the  BIOS will restart with default config and boot without problems. Also i  only want to activate the UV when playing games.  
I got TEMP high as a peaks of 80 - 85 ºC while playing some games.

So i lowered the frequency at 4400Mhz and the Voltaje to 1.2 and now i get max temps at 65.  


Now my questions are:  
 

**1-** I should try to low the Voltaje more or it's fine for that frequency?

**2-** Why **HWiNFO64**  shows the frequencies at 4400 Mhz all the time when it's not the  reality, because if i watch in RM i can see the frequency isn't at the  max and even some cores sleep.

Whenever I am playing games, the GPU Usage just always seems to be spiking up and down. I watched other people's benchmark videos of them playing like GTA V, CS:GO, DayZ with the same exact parts as me, same settings, and same graphics quality, and they always have their GPU Uitilasied to 90%-100% and it stays there, it's stable. For me, it always seems to be dropping and rising up and just doesn't seem to wanna stabilize. CPU is always between 50%-80% and therefore makes me think that it may be a bottleneck but I don't how, I've seen people saying that this GPU and CPU are a great combo. I just don't know what to do anymore.

Solutions I've heard might work and tried:

•	DDU Uninstaller.

•	Switch from Balanced to High Performance in Power Options.

•	Enabling Unified GPU Usage Monitoring in MSI Afterburner.

•	Lowering and Increasing Graphics Quality settings in Games

None of these worked.

I haven't played around with anything else, heard that going into BIOS and changing something might work but I haven't heard much more about that.

Amd,I built an AI transcoding benchmark to stretch even the Threadripper Pro 3995WX.,"So, about 15 months ago, I started working on a project to improve the quality of TV shows like Deep Space Nine, Stargate SG-1, and other mid-1990s sci-fi that's been effectively abandoned. I decided to take that work and use the concept as the basis for a transcoding and remastering benchmark that would step through the process of starting with old, interlaced SD footage, and end with the recompilation of the upscaled frames back into a watchable video. 

This is a workflow that can stretch even the Threadripper Pro 3995WX -- but it also showcases just how much horsepower AMD currently brings to the table in these systems. I intend to use the test in reviews going forward, so this is not a one-time effort. I built this benchmark specifically to scale on high-core count systems so that I could test Threadripper transcoding in a real-world (if high-end) workload that would be more applicable than just running multiple instances of Handbrake. 

[https://www.extremetech.com/computing/322415-introducing-tracbench-new-ai-powered-transcoding-benchmark-lenovo-p620-threadripper-pro](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/322415-introducing-tracbench-new-ai-powered-transcoding-benchmark-lenovo-p620-threadripper-pro)

It's currently in 0.1, but I'll be updating the application versions and releasing the actual code I run in the future, once I've tuned it a bit more. Topaz Video Enhance AI is a paid application with a trial period, but the other applications that I use are open source and can be run by anyone. 

The Threadripper 3995WX is an absolute beast of a transcoder. It leaves even the 3990X in the dust in the transcoding section of the workload. The AI upscaling (mostly GPU-based) and FFmpeg recompilation sections show different performance patterns, though, which illustrates where the 3995WX can and can't improve performance in this kind of application.",False,46,0,1,0

Amd,Ryzen 9 5900x Undervolting Help Needed,"Hi guys,

I  have recently bought a 5900x and for obvious reasons I don't have a GPU. I am using my old GTX 970 to play Dota 2 and other not very demanding games. Since I don't need that much of a power from my CPU I want to underclock/undervolt it. Also my 5 year old Corsair H80i Gt is too loud for me when the CPU is at full load (yes I'm going to replace it with something better soon). I have played around the OC setting at Ryzen Master (under full load the temp is 60C)

Now yes the 4GHz is enough for me but I am no expert at messing with OC settings, 

I wonder does the voltage looks good for you guys?

Is there supposed to be a ratio between the clock speed and the voltage even if the system doesn't fail and restart to default settings? 

Will it in any way damage my CPU if the voltage is low and the clock speed is high? (like my settings)

I guess you guys understood what I meant.

Thanks to everyone who wishes to spare some time for me!

Amd,FCLK @ 2000MHz caused USB issues on AGESA 1.2.0.2/gigabyte 13i bios (B550/5900x),"To start, I have a gigabyte B550 Vision D, and a 5900x cooled with an EK360 aio. As the title states, last night I was messing around with RAM OC'ing. My ram is 2x16 4000mhz CL18 G.Skill memory. I had been running it at 3800 to go 1:1 with the FCLK @ 1900, but wanted to tighten the timings. I wasted so much time, and ended up having my bios reset like 10 times making the most minute changes to the timings. Once it was reset, I figured I would see about running the FCLK @ 2000, with my ram at 4000--it actually worked. Booted it up, did cinebench multi and single core for just a few minutes to make sure it wouldn't crash. I don't have official scores to post, but mine have been terrible compared to other 5900x, and I would guess it is from terrible ram.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem came once I put my headphones on... CONSTANT crackling in my ears. I tried to go live to stream after attempting to solve this problem to no avail, EVERY USB DEVICE WENT BONKERS. Windows was screaming at me, pops and all, that usb devices were being plugged and unplugged constantly. Only after I changed the FCLK back to 1900 did the problem cease.

I got my 3600 for 170EU Nov 2020 and can sell for 155EU right now, while a 5600X is 300EU. This was my first upgrade after 8 years of same CPU so I'm very infrequent upgrader in terms of CPUs. I play on 1080P 144Hz. 

While the 3600 is sufficient for my GTX 1060, I plan on upgrading to an RTX 3060 TI once prices stabilize somewhat and the 3600 simply bottlenecks the 3060Ti in most CPU intensive games, Warzone especially (115 vs 150+ FPS), which would feel like throwing money out of the window when I won't be getting the full benefit of this powerful GPU. BF5 already gets bottlenecked by the 3600.

 Would you say it would be a smart decision to upgrade right now while the 3600 has a good value or would you not?  Money isn't an issue, but I don't like spending when I can avoid it. Just in my case I'm looking for 5+ years of decent performance in CPU intensive games and any future GPU will probably be bottlenecked by a 3600. I bought the 3600 in Nov as I couldn't play Warzone on my old rig anymore and 5600X were nowhere to be found then plus no B450 BIOS was available then, all of which has been rectified by now.

Amd,Help upgrade my PC,"#  Hello

I would like to upgrade the CPU of my rig.

So mainly I play games on this PC, sometimes I do some office work, watch Youtube etc. Nothing really heavy.

I noticed that a friend of mine who plays the same games as me had different results in FPS (higher). For example, in Valorant he gets around 250FPs stable, I get 200FPs with drops to 130FPs. I tried to limit the framerate to 144 but had drops to 120 + -.

I think my CPU is a bottleneck ATM so I want to upgrade.

I have seen good deals on the 3700X and 3800X, but the new 5600X is available for almost the same price as those two.

What would be the better upgrade for this situation? 3700x BC of the 2+ cores or a 5600X with the same number of cores I already have?

My motherboard is an Asus Prime B350 Plus. I'm using the BIOS version 5602, which is currently the latest one.

This could happen either while gaming or while browsing internet, it doesn't seems to be caused by anything in specific.

Pretty top end rig six years ago (ok, went from 780 Ti to 1080 Ti about four years ago)

Since I can't get a new GPU any time soon (aiming for 3080), I considered upgrading the rest of my components and going with a Ryzen 7 5800x, 2x8GB DDR4 3200MHz (probably add 2x8GB more later) on an X570 motherboard. That way I'll be ""up to snuff"" if/when I can actually get my hands on a new GPU.

The most stressful things I use my PC for is mainly gaming, although not as much as I used to. I do play the latest single player open world RPG/action type games like Cyberpunk. Plus I do some general video and photo editing and video encoding.

Although if a RTX 3080 were to fall in my lap tomorrow I would probably wait a year or more before upgrading the rest of my system, waiting on Zen 4, DDR5, etc.

The improvements seem pretty substantial on paper, but not sure if updating to 5800x will garner any significant performance gains for what I use it for.

First of all i found out that while im playing Forza Horizon 4 my PC is using 97% GPU when the game is on max settings also my fps is always aroud 100 which should not be the case with my components. The other things is when i for example try to lower my settings in Forza from Maximum to for example ultra my GPU usage drops to 70-80% and it remains like that, however even if i lowered my settings im getting the same FPS again, i tried lowerdig to a High or Medium and it's similar usage drops to 50-60% and my FPS is way worse. Why is this happening? Isn't it supossed to give 90%+ gpu usage no matter what settings are set in the game. My pc is acting like it saving energy, power or something like. The reason why this problem i bothering me is that i have 144hz monitor and i want 100% perfromance that i can get in games so i can put that 144hz to some use. All the drivers in my pc are updated and also this problem started before i updated the drivers and it still remained after updating so i don't think that a problem is related to drivers.

My MSI Gaming X Trio 6800XT doesn't detect my TV for whatever reason. I recently switched over from an RTX 3080 and was previously running a triple monitor setup, but ever since switching a couple weeks ago I've been running dual monitor as my TV hasn't been detected. I thought it was an issue with the HDMI port on my GPU so I bought an HDMI-DP adapter, but the problem is still persisting. What's interesting is that I unplugged the HDMI cable from my TV's side and my screens started flickering, so it appears as though the TV *is* giving off a signal, it's just not being detected by the GPU.  


Anyone have any ideas as to what is going on? I am on the latest drivers.

Scientific paper: [https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19598/nsf19598.htm](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19598/nsf19598.htm)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Researchers from two universities have discovered several new variants of Spectre exploits that affect all modern processors from AMD and Intel with micro-op caches. Existing Spectre mitigations do not protect the CPUs against potential attacks that use these vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, researchers believe that mitigating these vulnerabilities will cause more significant performance penalties than the fixes for previous types of Spectre exploits. However, it remains unknown how easy these vulnerabilities are to exploit in the real world, so the danger may be limited to directed attacks.   
&gt;  
&gt;Three New Types of Potential Spectre Attacks  
&gt;  
&gt;Scholars from the University of Virginia and University of California San Diego have [published](https://engineering.virginia.edu/news/2021/04/defenseless) a [paper describing three new types of potential Spectre attacks](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~av6ds/papers/isca2021a.pdf) using vulnerabilities of micro-op caches (thanks [Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Spectre-Micro-Op-Cache-Exploits) for the tip). The team of researchers led by Ashish Venkat discovered that hackers can potentially steal data when a CPU fetches commands from the micro-op cache. Since all modern processors from AMD (since 2017) and Intel (since 2011) use micro-op caches, all of them are prone to a hypothetical attack.   
&gt;  
&gt;The document lists three new types of potential attacks:   
&gt;  
&gt;A same thread cross-domain attack that leaks secrets across the user- kernel boundary;  
&gt;  
&gt;A cross-SMT thread attack that transmits secrets across two SMT threads running on the same physical core, but different logical cores, via the micro-op cache;  
&gt;  
&gt;Transient execution attacks that have the ability to leak an unauthorized secret accessed along a misspeculated path, even before the transient instruction is dispatched to execution.  
&gt;  
&gt;Fixes Going to Hurt  
&gt;  
&gt;Both AMD and Intel had been informed about the vulnerabilities in advance, but so far, no microcode updates or OS patches have been released. In fact, the researchers believe that since potential attacks must use mitigations in extremely low-level caches, it will be impossible to fix the weaknesses without severe performance impacts.   
&gt;  
&gt;The document describes several ways to mitigate the vulnerabilities.    
&gt;  
&gt;One of the ways is to flush the micro-op cache at domain crossings, but since modern CPUs need to flush the Instruction Translation Lookaside Buffer (iTLB) to flush the micro-op cache, frequent flushing of both will 'lead to heavy performance consequences, as the processor can make no forward progress until the iTLB refills.'   
&gt;  
&gt;The second way is to partition micro-op caches based on privileges. However, as the number of protection domains increase, such partitioning would translate into heavy underutilization of the micro-op cache, removing much of its performance advantages.   
&gt;  
&gt;Yet another way is to implement a performance counter-based monitoring that detects anomalies, but the technique is prone to misclassification errors, whereas frequent probing leads to significant performance degradation.   
&gt;  
&gt;Low Risk?  
&gt;  
&gt;One thing to keep in mind is that exploiting micro-ops cache vulnerabilities is extremely tricky as such malware will have to bypass all other software and hardware security measures that modern systems have and then execute a very specific type of attack that is unconventional, to say the least. To that end, chances that the new Spectre vulnerabilities will lead to widespread wrongdoings are rather low. Instead, they could be used for specific targeted attacks from sophisticated players, like nation-states",False,68,0,2,0

**reason why I'm posting this is**, what you can see is my max boost seem to be ""low"", in fact i never saw 46xxx or above (closest that i ever saw what 4575), since this cpu if from the first batches that was made when it got release, do I have any hope to ever get above 46xx?

I'm not interested in overclocking, at least not now and not since I got it. but I might be open to it in the future.

Amd,Rumor: AMD no longer launching Zen 3+ or any refreshed Ryzen CPUs in 2021,"[https://www.pcinvasion.com/amd-launch-ryzen-cancelled-zen-3/](https://www.pcinvasion.com/amd-launch-ryzen-cancelled-zen-3/)

&gt;According to recent rumors, AMD may have canceled its Ryzen Zen 3+ lineup (codenamed Warhol) which was expected to release in Q4 2021. The Warhol lineup of CPUs (Ryzen 6000 Series) was planned to be a refresh of Zen 3, however, there may have been a sudden change of plans. This news comes from PC hardware-focused YouTuber [RedGamingTech,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eXPCEeUZN4) who claims that several internal sources have provided him with this information.  
&gt;  
&gt;A couple of sources, which have been reliable in the past, suggest that Warhol has been removed from AMD’s internal roadmap. Additionally, there has been barely any mention of Warhol as of late, leading to the belief that plans have been scrapped. This could mean that AMD won’t be releasing any new Ryzen CPUs in 2021 and we may have to wait until Zen 4 in 2022 to see anything new.  
&gt;  
&gt;One possible reason for AMD’s alleged canceled lineup could be due to the minimal performance increase when upgrading from Zen 3 to Zen 3+. The increased instructions per clock (IPC) was reported to be anywhere from 3% to 10% on average depending on the applications. Unless AMD were to combine that small boost with something more significant like a shift to a 6nm node, it would make more sense for AMD to skip the refresh and jump directly to Zen 4. This strategy would offer a larger bump in performance with a new architecture that also supports DDR5 memory. Another major contributing factor could be the current silicon chip shortage which is causing AMD to [struggle with restocking](https://www.pcinvasion.com/gpu-cpu-shortage-nvidia-amd/) its existing Ryzen 5000 Series lineup.

 

&gt;Other complications  
&gt;  
&gt;Intel has one of its most ambitious CPUs [releasing later in 2021](https://www.pcinvasion.com/intel-alder-lake-release-date-rumor/) in the form of Alder Lake which is expected to be more powerful than the supposedly canceled AMD Zen 3+, especially while gaming. Intel’s CPUs will also feature a new big.LITTLE hybrid design and PCI Express 5.0. If the Zen 3+ is truly canceled, AMD’s Ryzen 6000 series may have to wait until 2022 to compete with Alder Lake. However, this information is based on rumors and should be taken with a grain of salt for the time being.

Amd,RX 5700XT DROPPING GPU USAGE,"So, basically couple days ago i realised that my pc lost it's performance in the most of the games that i play. While playing Forza Horizon 4 i noticed that my fps is around 100 which is not normal because it should be way bigger than that. I found that on the start of the game my FPS is 150-160 and gpu usage is around 95% after spending around 2,3 min in game driving my fps drops to already mentioned 100-110 and there is a drop in GPU usage, instead of 95%+ it is 60-70%. I have seen this problem in many other games not just Forza so it is not game related. Some of you will probably say that it is bottleneck, but i don't think so because my GPU works with Ryzen 7 3700x.   
Full specs are:  
GPU: Gigabyte AMD RX 5700 XT 8gb OC

CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 3700X

RAM: HyperX Fury 16gb 3.200mhz

MBO: Gigabyte X570 Aorus Elite

PSU:  **700W Cooler Master MWE** 

This problem is really pissing me off because im trying to play that are not that good optimized like 7 days to die for example and i can't get over 60fps in that because of my GPU usage drop (Before, without this problem i had more than 90 fps on max settings). I really have no idea what to do about all this stuff, i tried everything i can possibly do. I had heat problems on gpu before, but they are gone pretty much. I am not feeling like switching to Nvidia, i really liked performance with my gpu before this and i want that back. Also, i don't think that problem is related to the new drivers because problem started before i updated drivers. I updated them because i thought that will fix my problems, but unfortunetely it did not.",False,14,0,1,0

Been a month now that I put this system together, it's an ITX build, in the NZXT H1, using the Linkup PCIE 4.0 riser cable made for the NZXT H1 and PCIE 4.0 doesn't seem to be working. 

It's booting up fine, even when the BIOS is set to Auto, PCIE gen 4 and PCIE gen 3. GPU-Z shows it's always at gen 3 and so does the Radeon software.

I'm suspecting it's the riser cable the issue, but if it is the riser cable, why would it still not up when gen 4 is selected in the Bios. I haven't yet tested it outside the case where the GPU is plugged directly into the motherboard. I guess I should try that, maybe it's a motherboard issue? Any suggestions?

Since I was on an RX 480 as a stand in card, it was literally the same driver package, and the latest (21.4.1). And honestly I didn't really suffer before. Of course I DDU'd my system. Wont be upgrading to Threadripper soon enough to test it though.",False,10,0,1,0

Amd,Ryzen 5800x &amp; Fuma 2 temperature concern heading into summer.,"I bought my new gaming PC last November with a Ryzen 5800x and a Scythe Fuma 2 cooler. Hardware reviews at the time lead me to believe it'd perform not too far from an NH-D15 (I fell for the hype... though to be fair, I expected to pair it with a 5600x but those weren't in stock, so I splurged on an upgraded CPU). 

All through winter it performed well. Never exceeded 80C in Cinebench R23... but that was back when my ambient temp was around 60F / 16C. 

Now in late April my ambient temp is more like 80F / 27C and I expect it to get even warmer in July (it sometimes reaches 90F / 32C ambient in my room!). 

Already while playing No Man's Sky in VR my CPU typically hovers around 75C-80C and spikes to 90C, according to CPUID HWMonitor. 

I realize AMD says that 90C under load is [""typical by design""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/jsy8bw/robert_hallocks_response_to_all_zen_3_thermal/)... but that just means the CPU is guaranteed to last at least the warranty period (3 years) at that temperature. I'd like to keep mine going a lot longer than that. My old gaming PCs end up becoming hand-me-downs to family members, so they tend to get at least a decade or more of daily use.

I'm using a Phanteks P500A (non digital / mesh case). I don't think airflow should be a concern but I bought a couple extra case fans anyway (they'll be arriving next week).

I'm seriously considering getting an [Arctic Liquid Freezer 2 360](https://www.amazon.com/ARCTIC-Liquid-Freezer-All-One/dp/B07WNJCVNW) when they come back in stock, just to ensure cooling **won't** be an issue anymore... is that too crazy?

Any suggestions for what CPU cooler I should be using, given how warm it gets in the summer here? Or should I just stop worrying altogether?

I thought about an NH-D15, but I think it'd block my first ram slot (Tomahawk X570 motherboard, G.Skill Ripjaws memory). In addition, my old PC used an NH-U14S and it was a b*tch to install so I'd kind of like to avoid that difficulty.",False,15,0,1,0

Amd,Issues with new 6800 xt and 1440p 144hz display," 

Hi,

I've been trying to troubleshoot issues I'm having with my 1440p 144hz monitor. It's an Acer ED273UR I bought looking to benefit from its freesync with my new 6800xt gpu. However, I'm experiencing some pretty weird behaviour.

It started when I turned on VRR in my amd settings, note that without it being on none of these issues happen but I experience tear in my games. At first I was using my monitor with an HDMI 2.0 cable and wasc experiencing random black screens in games that lasted for a couple of seconds whenever the frames changed rapidly. I dabbled with a few settings but couldn't get it to work. I assumed it would be an issue with the cable and bought a DP 1.4 which arrived today.

I tried turning on VRR again (freesync) in my amd option and despite no longer experiencing those random black screens (so far) I do see some flickering, specially noticeable in titles like path of exile with heave changes in FPS.

now the weird part actually happens when I try to limit my fps on games where I can achieve higher frames than my refresh rate. It doesn't matter whether I do this via amd's radeon chill technology or in game, every time I limit my fps to 140 or below my flickering gets worse, I turned on the refresh rate counter in my monitor and it changes like crazy, I mean several times a second going from 144 down to 75 or lower and back up and this is only the case when I limit the fps in any way. if my fps is below 144 because of the actual PC not being abl to push it higher the refresh rate counter is stable at whatever fps i can achieve, but if I limit it that's when it starts going all over the place and flickering gets very noticeable.

I don't know if this is a GPU or a monitor issue or if there's anything I can do to fix it. according to AMD the monitor is freesync compatible so I really don't know what's going on.",False,17,0,1,0

Amd,5800x Undervolting / Clocking,"So I recently bought the 5800x teamed with an x470 ultra gaming mobo and a Noctua NH-u14s AIO. So I've noticed some temp issues when playing anything from Diablo, PoE, Cod, or even wow. Ive messaged around with the PBO and tried to find a good frequency / Voltage within Ryzen master as I've seen some threads recommending finding the frequencies / Voltages through Ryzen master and then inputting them into the Bios. Now theres my problem.. I cant figure out how to set a peak Frequency of 4.6ghz, and a peak voltage of 1.275 which seems to get me a cinebench r23 score of 15800-16000 which Im more than happy with. That voltage / frequency lowered my temps from stock by about 10 degrees as well which would be phenomenal.  Ive managed to find in the AMD CBS settings within my bios that I can set the limit of the EDC / TDC / PPT which I've found 115w for PPT, 100A for the TDC and 80A for the EDC. That gives me the boost of 4.6ghz, but also has the spikes for voltage go through the roof still hitting 1.5v. Is that spikage normal? or can I somehow find a way to have the voltage go between the average .25 or whatever its lowest is.. too 1.275v that I want to set the max too. Currently if I run the PBO settings for a frequence of 4.6ghz and Voltage to 1.275 the way I am it locks both of those numbers where they are and they dont fluctuate. Please help in any way if anyone has any input. I simply would like to find a way to allow the frequency and voltage to drop off a little and not constantly have the cpu locked at those numbers.

I'm not entirely surprised, tbh, that AMD would use Drupal for their own CMS and website overall. However, the store being a... store, and not needing ""CMS"" capabilities (and being a billion-dollar company) could have used some love instead of just being a reworked Drupal plugin (which by itself is already bad) that on top of that has to communicate with Digital River's own shit-of-the-art order management and processing system.

Is AMD really running gears for their store that are as low key as a kid with a YouTube tutorial and open-source framework's documentation could do on their free school time? For a billion dollar company? When there are at least a few good options out there from companies that actually specialize in running complete web-stores as a turn-key solution?  


I do understand that investment and cost are key, and that maybe it's not viable to dedicate a team of developers to brew their own state-of-the-art store front and backend... but come on. Does AMD really need the bad PR of Digital River providing customers with shit support and experience and TOP IT OFF with a broken and really bad solution for their store front?  


I mean, I love open-source and have used and developed a bit for Drupal in the past. I don't even agree with a Wordpress solution instead of Drupal in this case, given what this actually is. Drupal isn't the tool for an operation of this nature and size, gentlemen.  


Please, AMD. Hear us out on this: Your online store sucks BIG TIME (due to both DR and YOURSELF) and it is not even secure at this point.

Would anyone happen to know or be able to measure the size of just the heatsink? It looks like I would be able to remove the stock fan, and use the attachment underneath it to clip in a slim 92mm fan.

Just wondering how low these can get.

Amd,What's the current best practice with RAM config?,"I have a 3900X running on a B350 board (bought at launch of the 1700X) with 16 Gb (2x8) of GSkill FlareX 3200 CL14 RAM.

That has worked great - system is fast and stable.

I bought an X570 MB with a view to picking up an 5900X (or maybe even a 5950X drool, drool) but - like everyone else - I have been waiting on supply problems to get sorted out before paying inflated prices. That sexy new MB is sitting on my desk.

I recently learned, though, that Vegas Pro (my video editor software) *really* responds to RAM amount. Moving from 32Gb to 64Gb can drop render times by almost 4x (in what I suspect is related to how Vegas handles effects plugins and task scheduling) and given that I'm on 16Gb, it seems safe to say that the same scaling will apply.

So what I want to do is move from 2x8 to 2x16, with a view towards eventually going 4x16.

I can do this one of 2 ways:

1. Buy a pair of 16Gb sticks, drop them in the B350 board, and wait for the 59xxX purchase before moving to X570; or

2. Buy a pair of 16 Gb sticks, and swap the whole system to X570 now.

My first reflex would be to buy some FlareX 3200 CL14 sticks like I have now (which I know work fine on the B350 board) but I've lost the bubble on what the current Ryzen state of the art is. Maybe there is a better choice.

So then, what is the current Ryzen best practice, and how does it interact with 3900X/B350, 3900X/X570, 59xxX,/X570?

Amd,Samsung Odyssey G7 in HDR + Radeon Software = Rich buttery smoothness,"::TL:DR::
If your screen seems dim, washed, over saturated and solving one causes the other, the answer for me was going into Radeon Software &gt; settings &gt; Display &gt; and setting Color Depth to 10 bpc and Display Color Enhancement to Vivid Gaming. Along with the fastest refresh rate (non-MBR), oooh boy does this monitor look Good! Deep and rich colors, dark blacks without losing visibility and nice brights. My complete settings profile on the monitor is below the main post.
::TL:DR::


So, i thought I'd share my experience using an RX 6900 XT on this new monitor I got trying to get the most out of this beast. Seems to me the G7 monitors are calibrated to an NVIDIA card and so out of the box, I wasn't as impressed with this $700 monitor (I got the 27in) as I thought I'd be after testing the LG 850 and going through a number of reviews on the G7.

After a ton of tweaking and visually testing on a number of apps and games, I finally found the solution to the problems I was having! Read the TL:DR for the details on that. Will need to retest the LG 850 i have and see if these settings do that monitor any justice as well.  The washed look was even worse on that especially with HDR and any attempt to make it more vivid and contrasted was met with bad colors, yellow whites, and undefined dark blacks that also show the black screen bleed. Just really hard to look at when playing a game like RE: 2. I'll probably still keep the G7 because of the refresh rate and buttery smooth response times even if the Radeon Software solves these issues. And I doubt the LG's HDR will compare no matter what I do..Will definitely post my results on here later though.

Hopefully this helped anyone who was also less than impressed with the out the box look of the G7 or after twealong the settings on the monitor itself. Let me know if you had similar issues, different solutions, and/or id this helped or didn't help.

Below are my monitor and Radeon software settings.

G7 HDR Settings:
Brightneess - 80
Contrast - 75
Sharpness - 68
Color - R30/G30/B50 (varies from game to game where red is decreased and green is increased from here)
Freesync - off

Dynamic contrast - worth noting i turned this off before turning on HDR in windows. It is not an option when HDR is off and not sure if this had an effect on the visual quality of the HDR as I have not tested that variable but I'm inclined to think it does not matter.

Radeon Software settings:
Everything except the color depth and color enhancement are left at default or disabled.

I am on my 3rd Ryzen 5 3600 CPU. Each one ended it's runtime the same way.

Full Build will be corrected later today, but i don't know the correct names of everything.

CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3600
Mainboard: MSI MAG B550M Mortar WiFi
    BIOS-Version: E7C94AMS.100
GPU: Powercolor Radeon RX 5700XT Red Dragon
RAM: 2*8GB DDR4 3600hz (i think g-skill but will have to check) in Ch2
PSU: 550W(Brand will be added once i am home later)
OS: Win10

Back to the Ryzen CPUs:
The first one held for about 16 Months but one day without any load to speak of the screens go dark and nothing else is working. After restarting fans a running, but no image appears. 
CPU LED is on.
I removed the CPU, installed it again, no change.
I exchanged the CPU for a Athlon 200g PC is booting again, but with no network capabilities. Since the CPU had bent pins(corrected) from a past accident, I thought this were the very late consequences, so i bought a new one.
The new one installed - everything is working again.
Barely 2 Months later the CPU died again without a lot of load, everything same as before. My Athlon Booted again but again without working network adapter. 
I RMA'ed it with AMD, they sent me a new one, everything  is fine AGAIN. That was 6 days ago, yesterday evening my PC died again. Again with the same issues. 
This time I didn't exchange the CPU again... I am just burned out from this.

Amd,USB even with the latest BIOS fix seems to still be fundamentally broken.,"After many days trying to fix my new AMD system I have come to the conclusion that the latest BIOS update that is supposed to fix the USB issues is just covering it up, but does not really fix it. I indeed do not get the mouse/keyboard freezes anymore every 2 seconds, but almost none of my USB devices connected through any USB hub (different brands) work where on my old system I had no issues.

Also when debugging USB in Linux (usbmon, wireshark usb sniffing) it is clear that things are dropping out.

I did set PCI-E to Gen3 and disabled the global C-state etc. Made sure all OCing is disabled and even tried underclocking.

What happens in my case:

- My G27 Logitech wheel is detected as a Driving Force wheel on all ports except one (the red 10Gb USB 3.2 one).

- Most devices connected via a hub do not work and I get a ""device descriptor read/64, error -32"" (Linux) / ""device descriptor request failed"" (Device Manager) error.

From what I've heard I am still the lucky one. This same setup worked 100% fine on my old Z170A Intel-based setup.

I am sad to acknowledge that I may have to return all components within the 2 week return window including the 5900x which I got for a good price. I have no time to first go through all kind of standard support steps of which most I've already done.
Building up the new PC and debugging all issues took me 3 days. I personally believe this is a fundamental AMD chipset issue and the latest BIOS update is just covering it up (it is just a matter of time until it causes other issues). From what I've learned from 2 different people, even a PCI-E USB extension card will still have this issue.

I really hope they can resolve this all as good competition against Intel is highly needed.

Amd,PSA: Do not cheap out on the power supply,"Long story short, it seems Radeon RX 6000 had issues with my be quiet! 700W Pure Power.

Even though 700w should be plenty for the 6800, I had issues with its USB-C connection. Everything else worked just fine, no reboots, no crashes etc.

As I posted last week, my USB devices connected to the USB-C of the graphics card would regularly lose connection or have audio crackling.

Turns out after I upgraded to a 750W Streight Power (had bad fan on the Pure Power) this issue is gone!

I now play since 5 days with the new power supply and my 6900 XT and did not have any USB dropouts so far (knock on wood).

Maybe the power from the Pure Power was not stable enough for the USB controller in the Radeon RX 6000 or I just had a faulty power supply but anyhow I am happy that it is resolved for me :)

Now AMD just needs to look into better supporting an USB-C KVM :x",False,40,0,1,0

Amd,How exactly should I use Freesync?,"Hello,

So I'm a bit lost on how Freesync works and what to do with v sync. I just got a new 1080p 60Hz monitor that supports Freesync (btw there are two modes: standard engine and ultimate engine... which should I use?).

After I select one of the two engines on the monitor, do I enable Freesync somewhere in Radeon settings? And should I be using v sync as well?

I just simply want to know how exactly does Freesync work and how do I use it (for gaming).

I have continued looking for mini pc's, however the one I was aiming for is gone, the one with the ryzen 4500u, but I still want to know how the others ranked up to it.

I wanted to ask how each of these **Ryzen 7 3750h vs ryzen 4350g vs ryzen 4500u** ranks compared to each other in terms of both processing power, and graphics (seperatley? )

 ( I included ryzen 5 3550h just in case it is viable)

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I dont know if I am wrong, but as far as I can tell in terms of processing power it is:

1. Ryzen 5 4500u - 6 cores
2. ryzen 3 pro 4350g - 4 cores
3. ryzen 7 3750h - 4 cores
4. ryzen 7 3550h - 4 cores
5. ryzen 3 2200g - 4 cores ( old pc)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of graphics I am not sure, since I am not sure if vega improved over generations or stayed the same.

but would the rankings be:

1. ryzen 3 pro 4350g - has vega 6?, 1700mhz, 6 graphics cores

2. ryzen 7  3750h - has vega 10, 1400mhz, 10 graphics core

3.ryzen 5 4500u - has vega 6? 1500mhz, 6 graphics cores

4. ryzen 5 3550h- has vega 8, 1200 mhz, 8 graphics cores

5.ryzen 3 2200g - vega 8, 1100mhz, 8 graphics cores  (old pc)

&amp;#x200B;

Judging by this I would expext ryzen 5 4500u to be the best in both processing and gpu, but since it not available, would ryzen 3 pro 4350g or ryzen 7 3750h be far behind?

Amd,RMA Experience,"I just went through the process to go through AMD RMA, and I just wanted to put my experience here for others.

Ever since I got my 5600X around Christmas time, I've had nothing but issues with it. Crashing, poor performance, you name it, I had it. It would *sometimes* work on default settings, doing anything with PBO was completely out of the question in lieu of crashing, and was overall not the greatest experience. It was very noticeably unstable and ran very hot and performed worse than nearly any other 5600X I had seen. Despite all the troubleshooting I did it never really seemed to improve, and thus I came to the conclusion that my CPU was defective.

So, RMA process. Overall it wasn't too hard to get all the information they needed, though I do wish that they had explicitly said EVERYTHING they wanted before I did anything. I had to clean and repaste my CPU twice, not just once, because they wanted a picture of the serial number on the CPU, and then wanted a picture of the same thing except with a paper handwritten note of the RMA service number for some reason. That was pretty annoying and I wish they explicitly stated they wanted that in the beginning, but otherwise not a big deal.

The whole shipping process, once my RMA got approved, took about 2 weeks. While this may not be fully under AMD's control, this, in my opinion, is FAR too long for an RMA process, especially compared to someone like EVGA who can get an RMA done in under a week easily. I can't imagine going through this if I had a lot of time-sensitive work that needed done.

But in the end, it actually ended out pretty good for me. The new 5600X I received not only runs cooler and performs better, but I can now also use CO/PBO without crashing! While I am still overall happy with the product I (eventually) received, I can't help but feel that AMD could be handling their shipping a lot better. I do work off my computer, and while it isn't necessarily time-sensitive, I potentially lost a lot of business being out a computer for 2 weeks. Despite that it's still an overall net positive from me.

Would love to know how other people's RMA experience went. :)",False,2,0,1,0

**Now I changed my max clock to 2550**, all the other settings I have **left the same**. And what's the result?

Timespy finishes and gives me a graphics score of 19575.

5950x
Noctua 12s
x570 Taichi
rx570

I intend, eventually (if ever), to get a 5800xt for my base system (Fedora) and run various VM's (ten or so total) including a Win 10 gaming VM (for which I hope to pass-thru an RTX 3080).  Also running multi-RAID HD's for mass storage with 2 WD SSD's for main storage.

Sitting on my desktop in open air (not in case yet) I was still somewhat surprised:
The Corsair PSU says its fan will only spin up if it self-detects it needs cooling.  For the past hour it has not spun up since initial power-on spin-up yet cool to touch.

The Noctua 12s is insanely quiet.  It is spinning but I hear nothing unless I lean in closely where I can barely hear the air passing over the fins of the cooler.

Even the old rs570 fans only spin up occasionally and very slowly.  They are the loudest component and they are just a very, very low hum.

All to the point that my temps, even when running s-tui stress, never get above 40C average with a 63C max.

The hottest thing (to the touch) on this system seems to be the large motherboard heat sink that covers the two SSD's.  I am thinking the case fans might mitigate that but, as-is, when I say it is the ""hottest"" it is only warm to the touch, not really 'hot'.

Im an architecture student I dont live in the us so this is a one time thing, i dont want to make a mistake

Im buying it in 1 or 2 weeks The same model is also sold by walmart (actually both sold and shipped by anonline). Any reason to choose one over the other?

I bought a 6900xt tuf oc back in February and so far I am happy with it: very good performance in every game I tried, no driver issues  and good overclocking potential.

There is just one strange thing: Asus website says that the card comes with a 2340mhz boost clock a 2105mhz game clock  (OC mode bios values), while mine came with a 2529mhz boost clock and  a 2509mhz game clock.

These value are displayed in asus gpu tweak II and somehow confirmed by amd driver tuning panel which shows 2509 mhz clock as the default one. 

When I got the card it was brand new and sealed so I have no reason to believe that someone managed to tweak it before.

I am currently running my card at 2630 mhz, with 2150mhz memory, 1090 voltage and +15% power limit.

Is there anyone who owns  this card out there? What are your default clocks?

Amd,AMD Radeon Software High CPU and Power usage,"Recently I purchased and HP Pavillion Notebook, the last few days I notice that since startup the AMD Radeon Software, runs always at the top of the task manager list, sorted by CPU or Power usage. The problem is not the resources cosumption but the CPU temperatures that are always above 70°C for every core, putting the fans at the highest rpm setting all the time (My normal temperatures are about 40-50°C) . 

Before writing this post I researched a bit about the matter and I found out that this problem was affiliated with the ReLive service. The problem is that my laptop does have the Ryzen 7 4800H CPU and a dedicated GPU to use for graphics and so, following the steps for the ReLive issue is not solving anything due to the fact that the Radeon Software does not even have a tab for recording. Also in another forum a user wrote that the issue was solved by itself when updated windows 10 to version 20H2, a version already installed on my system and the problem still occurs. In this part I should point out that no updates were done on my laptop when I noticed this. 

For the time being I just shut down the process and all is back to normal, but this is not a solution. Does anybody have the same problem, or has any idea why is this happening and how to fix this ?

Amd,The battle of the chipsets - B550 vs X570 - which to get?,"Hello!  
So around a year ago, I've bought a new awesome gaming rig with a 3600X and a B450 board.  
I haven't expected it to come that fast, but I've managed to put my hands on a new fast and cool PCIe 4 M.2 drive, and now I obviously need to get a new motherboard to support it.

My question is, B550 vs X570! since these two chipsets exist for some time now, I wonder what will be the better option.

First of all, ill probably use the board on stock settings (ill probably set up a fan curve and enable PBO, but unlikely ill OC the CPU.

I've found an X570 board (Aorus Elite Wifi) and a B550 board (Aorus B550 Elite), and the prices of both boards and pretty much the same (both around 200$ each, new in box, just not from an official store).

So what board should I go with considering the fact they are both new in the box? If that matter, my next upgrade to the rig will probably be a new Ryzen 7 CPU (either 3000 or 5000, depends on the price), and I might upgrade to 32GB RAM as well, adding 2 sticks to my current 8x2 3200Mhz setup or buying 2x16 kit 3600Mhz if I end up buying a 5th gen CPU.

When I first got my rig everything was running great, but now about 2.5 months after using the machine nearly exclusively for VR and a couple of games I've been running into issues when I'm playing titles where the headset goes gray for a few seconds and all my controllers basically reset their connection with the machine. Occasionally on longer gray-outs I'll get the sound ding like something has been unplugged and plugged back into the PC.

I'm THINKING it's the USB issue from previous posts on here. I have not updated to the newest bios yet (still rocking the one from the end of Jan) but I've been waiting for MSI to release their next update just from what I've seen with issues with the profiles not loading properly on here to see if it addresses it.

What's weird is that this issue only started occurring within the last 3 weeks or so, and at first I thought it was the adaptive SS kicking in on the index so I turned that off, but it's still doing it. It seems like any time the GPU or the SSD is hit hard is when the drop occurs making me think it's related to the USB issue.

I believe there is a USB port or two on the back that bypasses the chipset and interfaces directly with the CPU, I'm wondering if that might be something to try.

So I've basically just set a date, set it and forget it and get by with what I've got. Then the rumors started kicking about as of late, that Warhol has been removed from internal road maps. AMD did this with 7nm, when they went all in. Given they don't want to let up, I feel like these rumors may be true, and this may be another 'all in' moment going to 5nm and skipping 6nm.

Amd,Tips to buy Hot! items such as GPU/CPU or Consoles!," Hey guys! I’ve been super lucky to pick up a RTX 3080 and a 5800x! Wanted to share some tips and tricks I have found to help the community out. Please upvote this if it helps you out.

Step #1. If you can, get any model possible. If you want a GPU the fastest, you might have to settle for a terrible AIB card but look a card is a card. If you stick to only 1 model, stick to that model. Keep refreshing it whenever there is a guaranteed drop time.

Step #2. Setup an account on every store such as Amazon, BestBuy and Newegg etc. Setup Apple Pay if you have the capability. It is always the fastest on most stores such as Newegg. It’s a 1 click checkout option and works the best (That’s how I got my card). If you have a microcenter, go to that microcenter on their designated drop days.

Step #3. Do not support scalpers. As much as they tempt you, DO NOT PAY OVER MSRP. When you buy something from them, it gives them more money to spend and keep scalping.

Step #4. Use other discord’s to help give you notifications. Make sure to have discord notifications get sent to your phone and use the mobile app for the fastest checkout.

Amd,POSSIBLE SOLUTION if you are experiencing driver timeout crashes on RX480/580 with 21.3 and 21.4,"TL;DR: Getting the latest Windows Updates might fix it for you too.

Whenever I turned on my PC, I would get one or two blackscreen crashes followed by the AMD Error Reporting tool telling me I had a driver timeout. These could happen while browsing the web on a chromium browser (even when no video or image was on screen), or while playing a game (I could reliably reproduce it by opening the driver software overlay).

After reading that some Nvidia users were having issues with Windows recently, I decided to check if Windows Update had anything for me, and after an update and reboot, I have yet to see the crashes pop up again. I even messed around with Performance Tuning while at it.

One thing that I find weird is that this new update won't appear in the history. It says my last update was on April 15. (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/april-13-2021-kb5001330-os-builds-19041-928-and-19042-928-cead30cd-f284-4115-a42f-d67fec538490)

I originally had a Ryzen 3600 but he stopped working, contacted AMD RMA here in my country and they refunded the price of the processor since they did not had another 3600 in stock. 

They gave me a fairly amount than the original price (I guess they recalculated with my country's inflation or some kind, and it is enough for a 5800x.).

My question is, if i get the 5800x and set It to eco mode, would my 212 EVO BE be enough to cool it on some games (while I save money for a new cooler) or will still run very hot?

I plan on using the processor for games, coding, and R* (an statistic software).

Coming from an i5 3570k with a gtx 970, switching to a Ryzen 3600, keeping the gpu for now.  Yes i know, rant..''but that gpu is soo old and bad'' yeah..might be true but 1. gpu prices 2. games i play. I mainly play stuff like league of legends, path of exile, elite dangerous, world of warships.. stuff like that, gpu performance is not my issue here. What is an issue tho are the facts path of exile is heavily cpu bound and i cant literaly not play and enjoy it without stuttering, and the other games i play do run above 144fps no problem BUT i still sit on an almost constant 90-100% cpu load while doing so so EVERYTHING background related like browsing stuff on the side, watching streams on the side becomes nearly impossible. i just need more cpu power for now.

Now B450 vs B550.  i know technicly B550 would be the obvious choice because ''its newer''  but that kinda only holds true if pricings are similar and i want my build to be ''cheap'' or lets say ''price efficient'' 

I can buy a B450 Tomahawk MAX II for 80Euros right now while Boards like B450M Mortar Max goes as low as 65Euros. Similar B550 Boards like the Msi B550 A Pro cost 120Euros and the only cheaper option would be something like a Gigabyte Gaming X V2 at 96Euros. I want to keep the option open to upgrade to a Ryzen 5xxx in like 5 years for example just because it feels nice to have the option to but the tomahawk 450 supports it too and for a price efficient budget build a 40Euros difference on the mainboard is actually pretty big for pcie4 that i will probably never even use.  The Gaming X V2 is something i could live with since its both quite similar but i heard so bad things about their vrms with 5xxx (wich in return is kinda dumb if i gonna buy that for the option to use them later on)

It was working fine then I tried to use it with my other 5600xt because I was gonna let my 5600xt mine etherium.  The psu was only a 650w but the 5600 only uses 85w when mining.. Once I tried that I couldn't start my system.  I went and picked up a 750w corsair psu and went through a ton of crazy getting the system running again.  Since I wanted to see how fast I could make it my OS is on 2 samsung 980 pros in a raid0 array.  So that made getting things working even trickier.

After a lot of issues I ended up swapping my motherboard for an Asus tuf x570 spare I have. And at some point I had it all working again.  Then I put the 5600xt in and the Radeon software no longer sees the 6800.  I can only get video from the 5600.  I can put the 6800 in and windows sees it and it installs but it doesn't have any video output.  If I try just running the 6800 the system bios doesn't detect it on either my Asus or my gigabyte x570 master mobo.

I think the card is stuck in some half on state.  I have looked into disabling ulps and tried a utility for that but still no luck.  Is there anything I could do to wake this card up?

Anyone have suggestion for good, stable board - looking to spend up to $400.

Also, regarding stability - what are general thoughts on ECC ram? There are a lot of opinions out there, looking to get some more I guess. It seems if I go that route, ram selection is limited and speed seems to be as well to 2666 or 3200 from Nemex - have not heard of them before today.

Amd,Faulty 5950x?,"For anyone with a 5950x, are you getting similar numbers or no? As I think I may have a faulty 5950x. 

Reasons why I think this:
When I play Warzone, I get around 115-135 FPS, but when I play Warzone with OBS on (I don't even need to be streaming or recording anything, I can have preview in OBS off too), and I'll lose FPS to where my average FPS sits around 80-105. Just having OBS on doing nothing will hurt performance in Warzone. That doesn't sound right for a 'powerful multitasking' cpu, does it?

Amd,RDNA 2 + LG C9 VRR is still broken,"VRR on LG C9 TVs does not work. This is a feature of the HDMI 2.1 spec which, allegedly, RX 6800/6900 series cards support. The TV is not the problem, as Ampere cards and the new consoles both support VRR on this TV and those work as expected. I am expecting to be able to enable 4k/120hz/10bit HDR/VRR all at the same time, all of which work but the last one. I've looked all over the internet and people with this TV are experiencing the same problem. 

I've tried with an RX 6800 and RX 6900XT. There used to be a workaround on older AMD cards using CRU to trick the TV into thinking it could support Freesync, this not longer works on RDNA 2. How long will this problem go on? It's been reported on AMD forums, LG forums, and here. Like.. how is this not false advertising? LG C9/B9 are not fringe TVs.. I think what's really keeping this under wraps is that no one can buy the cards in the first place.

Anyways, Frank Azor mentioned that bugs are addressed in order of popularity (among other considerations) on a livestream for the new drivers recently. Maybe we can get some traction on this to get their eyes on this problem? Open to other suggestions as well.

3 weeks ago I bought compulsively a Sapphire 6800XT Nitro+ OC for 1190€ (ebay).

This weeks I managed to buy a reference 6800XT MB &amp; a 6700XT from the amd store.

There is a guy in my town that want to exchange my nitro+ for his 3080 FE.

What GPU should I keep ?  


* 6800XT Nitro+ (Coil Whine in some games menus but not in games thanks to AMD Chill Features).
* 6800XT MB AMD, because it's cheaper &amp; good enough.
* Lowering my performances &amp; keeping the 6700XT.
* Exchange the Nitro for the 3080FE, sell it on the after market or maybe use it.

My setup : B450, 5600X, Freesync 1440p Monitors.

*(I intend to sell the remaining GPU with a short margin to get little money)*

I already tried to sell my Nitro+ at the same price I got it, but since 1 week ... no luck.

Please don't throw stones at me too quickly , I know the choice I have right now is crazy during this shortage but it's been nearly 3 months I try to get a new GPU &amp; since I'm unemployed extra cash is welcomed.

Thanks in advance,

Take care !",False,30,0,1,0
Amd,"Meaning of AMD hardware names (CPUs, GPUs, motherboard chipsets)","Numbers with three or four digits, sometimes a letter as well... What do all these names mean?

That strange number should be separated into first, second and other digits like this: 6|9|00 (6900).

First digit is the generation. New hardware will increment this digit. The best is 5, except for GPUs.  
Second digit is the model. Better hardware has a higher second digit. The best is 9 (very expensive).  
Other digits (one or two) are often zero (0), other values mean better performance than the 0 or 00.

# AMD CPU names (What does Ryzen 5 5600X actually mean?)

First digit (5 in 5600X) is the generation. A higher first digit is important, it means newer hardware.  
Newer AMD CPUs have higher single core performance, as well as better RAM compatibility.  
Zen CPUs begin with 1 or 2 (for APUs), Zen+ with 2 or 3, Zen 2 with 3 or 4, Zen 3 with 5 (a jump).

Second digit (6 in 5600X) is the model. A higher second digit means more cores, better performance.  
The best CPUs have 9 as the second digit, they are very useful for productivity (like video editing).  
1, 2 or 3 means Ryzen 3, they are quad core CPUs useful for basic usage, as well as basic gaming.  
4, 5 or 6 means Ryzen 5, they are 6 core CPUs, good for gaming and they are usually the best value.  
7 or 8 means Ryzen 7, they are 8 core CPUS, the best for gaming and good for productivity software.  
9 means Ryzen 9, the best for productivity. They have at least 12 cores. This includes Threadripper.

The last two digits are used for differentiating Ryzen 9 and Threadripper CPUs. Like Ryzen 9 5950X.

A CPU ending in XT is better than the same CPU ending in X, which is better than not ending in a letter.  
A CPU ending in G is a desktop APU. It has integrated graphics, can be used without a discrete GPU.  
A CPU ending in GE is an OEM-only lower powered (35 W) version of a desktop APU (ending in G).  
A CPU ending in WX is a workstation Threadripper CPU with better single core performance than Epyc.  
A CPU ending in AF is a refresh on 12 nm instead of 14 nm. Like Ryzen 3 1200 AF and Ryzen 5 1600 AF.  
A CPU ending in U is a low power laptop CPU, one ending in H is a high performance laptop CPU.  
CPUs ending in HS or HX are still high performance laptop CPUs. S is lower power, X is the opposite.

# AMD GPU names (What does Radeon RX 5800 XT actually mean?)

First digit (5 in 5800 XT) is the generation. A higher first digit is important, it means newer hardware.  
Newer AMD GPUs may be built on better process nodes and they have better performance, of course.  
There are older series with three digits (GCN) and newer series with four digits (RDNA-based GPUs).

Second digit (8 in 5800 XT) is the model. It starts with 5 for entry level and ends with 9 for high end.  
RX 580 is actually middle range, while RX 590 is still middle range, but newer (on a 12 nm process).

The only suffix is XT, which means that RDNA is much better and a competition for NVIDIA, as well.

# AMD chipset names (What does an X570 chipset actually mean?)

First digit (5 in X570) is the generation. It is 3 for Zen CPUs, 4 for Zen+ and 5 for Zen 2 and Zen 3.  
The compatibility is more complicated than that. Sometimes a BIOS update may be necessary.

Second digit (7 in X570) always corresponds with the prefixed letter: 2 for A, 5 for B, 7 for X. Just that.

There are no suffixes, but there is a prefix which can be A (entry level), B (mainstream), X (high end).  
A series motherboards do not allow overclocking. X series are not actually necessary for most people.

There are also Threadripper motherboards, with chipsets X399 (Zen and Zen+) and TRX40 (Zen 2).",False,10,0,1,0

It does not take very long although you might have to run it a few times just to get an average number. Also, it would be helpful if you can state whether you're using intel MKL (+ version number) or OpenBLAS. For MKL, you can find out your version number by doing:

    import mkl
    mkl.get_version_string()

Some background:

I'm sure we are familiar with the issue regarding [intel mkl](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/ik4bt9/intel_recently_updated_their_cripple_amd_function/) running slower on AMD cpus by now.

However, I'm just curious as to how well the current TOTL AMD CPU's do regarding Python workloads which is not commonly talked about in consumer benchmarks. I know they're hard to get at the moment but I'm really considering upgrading my existing desktop in the future. I use a lot of python (numpy, scipy, scikit-learn) for work/school so this would be very helpful.

Amd,Is 5000 series CPU's Limited Without PBO (My experience with the 5950x),"hey everyone  
Ive had my 5950x for just over a week now and my experience has been interesting to say the least. After putting it into my system I found it very underwhelming with only a 3.8ghz all core boost on aida64 and cinebench r23 with very high temperatures altogether. after research, I found a lot of other people were having the same issue such as optimumtech and his itx motherboards making me think that motherboards were an issue. With PBO on just set to enabled in bios, it definitely improves the all core boost going to 4.45-4.5ghz but temperatures were EXTREMELY close to 90  
The temperatures actually ended up being a really bad thermal paste (thanks corsair) and after fixing this my temps did drop a fair amount into the 80s on load with PBO which I'm ok with but stock I was hoping the lower temperatures would increase all core boost but alas it did not. just to make sure I wasnt going paranoid I went back and looked at youtubers reviews  
jayz2cents saids his boosted to 4.3 stock  
Hardware unboxed said his was 4.195  
Kit Guru had a very similar experience to mine with 3.8 stock and 4.5 boost  
not many other specified boost vs pbo clocks

So what i want to know is what has your experience been with 5000 series cpus with stock clock speeds vs pbo, what motherboard are you using, what bios settings as much detail would be really interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

performance wise, it's great. ONLY for games that are hard to run. I get 150+ fps 1440p res on high settings for warzone, PUBG, Raft, and solid 60 fps for genshin impact.

but for valorant, I get 120-180 fps on the lowest settings possible 1440p. I am not too sure on what is limiting the performance here. Many youtube benchmarks shows me that I should be getting like at least 200 fps+ on the highest settings possible. I used to get 150-200 fps on lowest setting for gtx 1060 3gb so I expected 400-500 fps with the same settings on rx 6700 xt. I tried high settings and fps was still similar, 120-180 fps.

Any simple solutions to these?

Also what is amd gpu's best with? like the games or game engines. I was told that stock minecraft is not one of them. (I installed optifine for Java minecraft but only went from 60 ish fps to 100 ish fps on same settings)

If I want to mostly play games like minecraft, valorant, league of legends, gta v, is this amd rx 6700 xt not the gpu to go for? should I try to get a nvidia rtx 30 series card? All I wanted was a really fast GPU that is an easy plug in and play that would give me 3 times the performance of my gtx 1060 gpu  

and is there a need for me to upgrade my motherboard to get the full 3200 mhz ram speed? 

do I also need a better case?

Amd,5950x struggling at... multi-tasking two programs?,"So I'm not 100% sure yet if this is a ram or CPU issue. I currently have 32GB of ram and a 1080ti, Ryzen 5950x. My issue is that I'm noticing weaker performance when running two 'demanding' programs at the same time.

When I play Warzone, I get around 115-135 FPS, but when I play Warzone with OBS on (I don't even need to be streaming or recording anything, just having OBS on alone), and I'll lose FPS to where my average FPS sits around 90-110. If this is a ram issue, I'm thinking if I upgrade my ram to 64GB, will I be able to get the same amount of FPS in Warzone with OBS on, than I normally do without OBS? I assume the reason why I'm losing FPS in Warzone with OBS is due to not having enough ram to satisfy both Warzone and OBS.

But if this is not a ram issue, but a problem with the cpu itself, is there perhaps some setting I need to enable for the 5950x to keep performance up despite having OBS on? I'm of course running OBS as administrator, have game mode and hardware graphics acceleration on.

GPU could be the third culprit here, but considering that Warzone is mainly a cpu intensive program, I'm not really thinking too much about that.

I should also note, that whenever I try to tab out of Warzone (with OBS on) and try to browse something on the net, my system will act pretty slow... I wasn't exactly expecting something like this from the so called beefy 5950x, but yet here we are.

I switched from backing up using SFTP to backing up directly to an USB 3.0 external hard drive (connected to the PC with the USB 3.2 Gen2 port on the back panel). This is were I first discovered very weird USB behaviour. What seemed a little odd at first was that sometimes Windows Explorer goes to “Not Responding” when simply showing the contents of the drive. But it got worse.

After copying about 100 GB (with speeds of 40-130 MB/s) the transfer rates started to drop to zero every few seconds. Also the transfer rate won’t go beyond 1-2 MB/s anymore for that copying process.

Stopping the copying process makes things even worse. Some of the things that happened:

\- Windows Explorer stopped showing any drives at all, it didn’t even show “This PC” anymore.

\- The backup drive wasn’t readable anymore and had to be formatted to work again

\- Files that got already copied had different binary contents than the source files

\- The whole system got unresponsive

\- Ryzen Master didn’t show any values any more (no temps, no voltages, …)

I tried another PC where all the files were copied without any problems. So I am pretty sure about the external hard drive being ok.

I couldn’t find anything related to this behaviour because it seems most people have problems that their USB devices randomly disconnect which I never had. Also while copying I never experienced any USB disconnects.

I've been helping gamers get their GPUs from various retailers for the past 8 months, so I have an in-depth understanding of how various retailers operate.

AMD has been getting a lot of flak over the past few days, with multiple media outlets picking up a so-called AMD.com ""vulnerability"" and running with it without really bothering to check their facts:

* [https://www.pcmag.com/news/bug-in-amds-online-store-allowed-people-to-easily-buy-graphics-cards](https://www.pcmag.com/news/bug-in-amds-online-store-allowed-people-to-easily-buy-graphics-cards)

* [https://hothardware.com/news/amd-web-store-vulnerable-add-cart-bot-raids](https://hothardware.com/news/amd-web-store-vulnerable-add-cart-bot-raids)

\*sigh\*, where do we start?

**Here's a controversial opinion**: Over the past few months, the team at AMD has been one of the most proactive in their fight against bots and they deserve some respect for that.

# Chapter 1: Direct add-to-cart links and complete botting free-for-all

For a long time, Digital River interface at shop.amd.com allowed people (and bots) to completely bypass [www.AMD.com](http://www.AMD.com) website and order directly through Digital River, bypassing any anti-bot measures they might have had in place. DigitalRiver is well-known for being easily botted, which is also why Nvidia stopped relying on them for the fulfillment of Founders Edition GPUs.

Every week, various forums such as Hardwareluxx would publicly post new direct add to cart links, that looked similar to this:

[https://shop.amd.com/store?Action=buy&amp;Locale=#{locale}&amp;ProductID=#{product\_id}&amp;SiteID=amd](https://shop.amd.com/store?Action=buy&amp;Locale=#{locale}&amp;ProductID=#{product_id}&amp;SiteID=amd)

That link would lead you to this page, away from the slow AMD.com website and away from any required captchas: 

https://preview.redd.it/vq7q2dtbjzu61.png?width=2178&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb03397fb1c2703b8056f7109769940058c30ae8

These links would quickly be patched, usually, the day after they became publicly known. There is more than one way to craft these special links, so this kept going for more than a few weeks.

We also had:

* [https://shop.amd.com/store?Action=AddItemToRequisition&amp;Locale=#{locale}&amp;ProductID=#{product\_id}&amp;SiteID=amd](https://shop.amd.com/store?Action=AddItemToRequisition&amp;Locale=#{locale}&amp;ProductID=#{product_id}&amp;SiteID=amd)
* [https://shop.amd.com/store?Action=AddItemToCart&amp;SiteID=amd&amp;Locale=#{locale}&amp;productID=#{product\_id}](https://shop.amd.com/store?Action=AddItemToCart&amp;SiteID=amd&amp;Locale=#{locale}&amp;productID=#{product_id})

*I hope AMD found the last one as amusing as I did when I first crafted it. :-)*

There were other combinations of various domains and `Action` parameters, but you get the idea. Every Thursday, people who knew about these links would frantically refresh them and often manage to check out faster than most people even knew the cards were in stock.

Caching on [www.AMD.com](http://www.AMD.com) *sucks* and you would often have to wait for 5-15min *after the drop* to even see the Add to Cart button appear.

# Chapter 2: The so-called ""vulnerability""

About a month ago, AMD blocked or patched all publicly known direct add to cart links described above - at least to my knowledge. Aside from direct add-to-cart links, there was at least one method of checking the stock status left unprotected.

## Breaking news: Add to cart button adds the product to your cart 😲

Add to Cart buttons are very useful creatures, when you click on them, you usually expect 1 of 2 things to happen - either the product is added to your cart because it's in stock, or you see a message saying that the product is out of stock.

And that's exactly what happens on AMD.com - this is *normal* and to be *expected*. Let's dive a bit deeper into this.

Let's say that you can see the add to cart button for Ryzen 5800X on AMD.com. Here's what happens when you click on that button:

1. Your browser sends a request to [https://www.amd.com/en/direct-buy/add-to-cart/5450881600](https://www.amd.com/en/direct-buy/add-to-cart/5450881600)
2. The server replies with *some* data.

* If the product was successfully added to the cart (indicating that the product is in stock), you will see this pop up: 

https://preview.redd.it/dgxvynafjzu61.png?width=807&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dd5b872f9af0073a6ebdf7ddb15948b5da577b1

* If the product is out of stock, it won't be added to your cart, and you'll see the following pop up:

https://preview.redd.it/gftkn9chjzu61.png?width=797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9db7a3699a2f44fbd41961331790191f7df03a6d

Looking at the raw response from the server, you can see that the successful response contains the product name and ""Go to checkout"" text here: 

https://preview.redd.it/zbmnzrnjjzu61.png?width=2436&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30bb437342db164d1540270465a4fc6ffbc2fce5

If we circle back to the first 2 posts on this topic, the Redditors call attention to *other* information that's included in this successful response, namely some data from DigitalRiver, which in addition to binary in-stock/out-of-stock status also includes the exact quantity of products in stock:

While one could argue that this is a sensitive information leak (depending on whether AMD considers the number of products available in each drop confidential), this data does not help auto-checkout bots buy the products.

**This is not something that AMD can patch**, this is simply how **ALL** websites work, when you click on a button, something happens and you (hopefully) get feedback on what has happened - in this case, whether the product was added to your cart, or not.

**Let me be clear, this reported ""vulnerability"" did not give bots any significant advantage,** despite what the previous posts said or what the media reported.

Bots simply used this information to know when the products were in stock. There's nothing for AMD to patch.

People that were running scripts based on this method for alerts, but then completed checkout manually, were able to skip 1 step of the process (adding the product to their cart).

This is not a ""vulnerability"", it's just partial automation of the checkout flow that everyone has to go through.

# Chapter 3: The aftermath

After the direct add-to-cart links were patched, AMD likely saw a huge increase in traffic to their main storefront. Not accounting for other communities, over 60,000 users from PartAlert, as well as all of the bots hitting their add-to-cart API, were suddenly directed to [www.amd.com](http://www.amd.com) (hosted by AMD) instead of shop.amd.com (hosted by DigitalRiver).

AMD's website (*and PayPal*) completely crashed during the following 2 drops. This probably lead them to implement the captcha which appears every time you click on the Add to Cart button.

Requiring a captcha to be solved before every add-to-cart attempt presents a non-trivial obstacle to bots. Bots used to be able to check for stock 100+ times per second if they wanted, without incurring any significant costs, while captcha-solving services usually cost around $3/1000 attempts.

This is where we are now - bots that have to either massively slow down or pay the price of captcha-solving services.

In addition to captchas, AMD has also added other bot protection mechanisms over the past two weeks. While I can't comment on their effectiveness against auto-checkout bots, it does show ongoing progress in their fight against the bots &amp; scalpers.

## TL;DR:

Post #1: There was no vulnerability in the first place. AMD sent over a t-shirt and the entire story was blown out of proportion.

Post #2: Misguided reply to the original post, AMD continuing to expose the stock quantity does not give the bots any advantage.

## Current AMD.com situation

For the past few weeks, it's been relatively easy to get your hands on AMD.com GPUs. In Europe they usually drop anywhere from a few hundred to 1k+ units every single week. We've had hundreds of confirmed *manual* orders.

Amd,Good ultrawide monitor with freesync for gaming and programming?,"Hi fellows,

After some neck problems with my dual 24"" monitor setup (both BenQ GW2480), I decided to move to an ultrawide monitor.

I would like to use it mainly for programming, so I want a monitor with good resolution and plenty space for productivity, so I think at least 34"" 3440x1440 will be a good choice, but I'm open to any kind of constructive opinions.

I usually play video games on weekends, so taking advantage of this upgrade, I would like to pick a good monitor for gaming too. Thinking that freesync could be a good enhancement to get the full potential of my Radeon RX 5700 XT.

I wouldn't like to invest more than 500€, but I'm open to increase my budget if it will be worthy in the long run, as I'll spend more than 10 hours per day looking at it.

I'm using a noctua NH-D15 with a single fan config.

TLDR: Is a single threaded workload on a 5950X being hotter normal than an all core workload normal/is there an explanation for it?

CPU Max: 59.4 C  
CPU Average: 54.5 C  
CPU Min (normal desktop usage): 37.5 C, right after the single core test

Another thing I'd like to ask is that if it's normal for my CPU to have an all-core vcore of around 1.008 volts, while on the single-threaded test it maintained a vcore of around 1.48 volts. However the single-threaded test boosted to \~4.8ghz, the all core only boosted to around 3.74ghz.

As the title say, I'm waiting to get my hands on my RX 6900 XT which I've been able to buy during the drop two days ago.

I'm going to leave the 1080p@60 and make the jump to 1440p or 4k.

My pc is connected to my tv, Samsung RU8000, which has native support for 1080p@120hz, 1440p@120hz (with freesync) and 4k@60hz. Here comes my questions:

* Would it be better to choose 1440p and take advantage of the 120hz and freesync? Or choose 4k resolution?
   * I only play AAA single player games and I'm more convinced to go 1440p@120. My idea was that (given that I want to keep my pc for at least 5 years without spending any more money) going 1440p@120 would make me able to max up the graphics settings and still get &gt;60fps for quite a long time (in theory) and not to worry about anything. Is it a right thought?

I reach peak temperature of 90.4 Degree Celsius for the CPU with the multicore Test in Cinebench R23  
Thermal Throttling does not kick in as far as i can see from HWinfo.  
The system runs stable, no crashes, no bluescreens. Furmark runs the GPU up to 71°C, while CPU averages around 70°C after peaking to 75°C.  
M2 SSD peaks to 51°C but averages out at 48 (sitting between CPU and Graphiccard)

In general I would leave it as it is.   
No OC (Beside RAM XMP Profile usage), but the 90.4°C peak concerns me a little.  
I expect the PC would throttle or turn off, before the CPU gets too hot.  
I have to say I expected lower temps for CPU with that Dark Rock Pro 4.  
At the same time I read some articles/blog/posts about Ryzen 9 can stand the 90°C peaks without shortened lifetime or any issues.  
So I am looking for input, if I should be more concerned about the temperature peak or not.

Amd,"Just upgraded to a 3600, after 10 yrs on an i7 965, need help understanding temps, voltages &amp; frequencies","Hello ! As title said, i've been using an i7 965 for the past 10 years, so not only do i know nothing about AMD cpu's behavior, but my knowledge is also very outdated


I have been monitoring a bit and i noticed vcore varies a lot, going up to even **1.44v**, is this normal? Temps seems to be alright, going up to about **70-75°c under heavy load**, and in the **60s ingame**, while frequencies under heavy load hover around **4.1Ghz all core. I have seen 4.2Ghz happen, even all core, but not during cinebench runs**, i'm not sure why.


I basically have everything in auto in the bios and i just went and **enabled PBO**, which seems to have given me some gain in cinebench, but now it seems to be running at **1.375v and jump between 3.6 and 4.2Ghz IDLE**


I kind of forgot to check if it had a lower voltage &amp; frequencies before turning PBO on. Idle temp with that voltage &amp; freqs hover around 34-38°c with a CM hyper 212 BE



None of it seem very concerning at first glance but i'd rather ask, as i really don't know much except from videos from famous youtubers (GN, Linus, etc)


Oh and i've ran the diagnosis from ""CTR"" but haven't applied anything, i mostly wanted the diagnosis first (which i ran before enabling pbo btw, if that changes anything)

Here are the results 


&gt; DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS

&gt; AMD Ryzen 5 3600 6-Core Processor

&gt; CPU VID: 1120

&gt; CPU TEL: 1094

&gt; Max temperature: 60,3°

&gt; Energy efficient: 3,7

&gt; Your CPU is SILVER SAMPLE

&gt; Recomended values for overclocking (P1 profile):

&gt; Reference voltage: 1250 mV

&gt; Reference frequency: 4225 MHz

&gt; Recomended values for overclocking (P2 profile):

&gt; Reference voltage: 1350 mV

&gt; Reference frequency: 4375 MHz

&gt; Recomended values for undervolting:

&gt; Reference voltage: 1175 mV

&gt; Reference frequency: 4075 MHz

------------------------

I have no idea what P1 &amp; P2 are but i have to say, 4375mhz at 1.35v would look a lot more appealing than 3.6-4.2 at 1.375-1.44v


Is there no ""idle state"" kind of thing where the cpu wouldnt run at 1.375 and max boost all core when its doing nothing? Or is this happening because of PBO?

I had issue after issue with the ram when I ran it at 3200. 
I’ve got a mortar Max board and everything said it was fine, but BSoD after BSoD at 3200 had me failing it back and then not an issue. 

Fast forward to last week, I found a hood deal on the last of stock on the 3600 at a shop. 

Dropped it in and it was a heap better. 

Then Monday I thought I’ll try the ram at 3200. 
Now I’ve only changed the CPU, nothing else and bang. 
I’ve got it pumping all week, not 1 error, running photoshop, Lightroom, photo booth programs, even gaming. Ram cinebench and got high 9000s, the old CPU I was lucky to get 3000 and that was if I didn’t have a BSoD. 

So I’m thinking the 3400G and 3200 ram doesn’t work",False,25,0,1,0

Recently I been looking at various processers like the i5-8259u and ryzen 5 4500u in search of the best mini-pc / nuc for my sister. And out of curiosity on how they compare to ryzen 7 1800x. 

I have been using this website to compare

[https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i5-8259U-vs-AMD-Ryzen-5-4500U/m543736vsm1052299](https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i5-8259U-vs-AMD-Ryzen-5-4500U/m543736vsm1052299)

where they all seem to be in the same ballpark since according to the ""effective speed"" on those websites, they are almost as good as the 1800x despite being low wattage processors.

But I have to ask are they really that good? 

And if not, what should I look for when comparing processors in order to get an understand of what is better than what?

I have been successful in modifying voltages and frequencies for gpu core and gpu memory. However I have an issue with the memory clock.

The thing is as follows: these are the default MHz and mV gpu memory states:

OD\_MCLK:

0:        300MHz        750mV

1:       1000MHz        800mV

2:       2000MHz        950mV

this is found in file pp\_od\_clk\_voltage (you can find this file using `readlink -f /sys/class/drm/card0/device`)

under these default settings, my gpu memory freq is always at 2000MHz (monitored using `sudo watch cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/amdgpu_pm_info`). However, If I ever change the memory state 2 freq to something as insignificant as 1900 or 2001, automatically my gpu memory freq drops to 300MHZ (state 0). This causes flickering in the screen. You can imagine the panic that this flickering causes, therefore I immediately restore to default values (state 2: 2000MHz). Doing this restore the gpu memory clock to 2000MHz.

This leads me to think that the “overclock” didn’t work, and that my gpu memory was unable to run at different clock speeds, however, by an accident, I modified the state of the gpu memory while mining, and voyla!! the gpu memory got the desired value. Thus I understood that, when modifying the default memory clock of state 2, for some reason unknown to me, it causes the memory to use the state 0 or 1 for memory clock, causing the screen flickering (under low gpu usage off course).

So it seems that memory clock is always at state 2 by default, however, whenever modification are done to this default setting, states 0 or 1 are used depending on the gpu load.

This is my first time doing overclocking, so I am kind of lost here. Is this behavior normal? State 0 or 1 for gpu memory are ever used? How to avoid this clock drop and screen flickering? (I have thought in modifying state 0 and 1 to avoid this but I am not really sure how save is this).

USB-C -&gt; KVM -&gt; Display and USB Hub


Never had any issues with this setup and it ran flawless.

Since Nvidia decided to ditch it's USB-C connector I decided to go with the Radeon 6000 series since it included one.


1. Does not work with default Windows driver, only shows blackscreen -&gt; fixed by installing latest drivers


2. My monitor can change the resolution (from 5120x1440 to 3440x1440 for example). With the 2070 Super, Windows recognised that the resolution changed and adapted. With the 6900 XT the resolution does not change resulting in displaying 5120x1440 compressed to 3440x1440...


3. Since I use a KVM I am able to switch between my Laptop (also connected via USB-C) and my computer. This worked flawlessly with the 2070 super. However with the 6900 XT there is one big issue. I cannot switch the KVM while my PC is running. I need to shut it down or power it off. Otherwise when I switch back to my PC I have a blackscreen (PC does not seem to recognise that the monitor reconnected). Replugging cable also works sometimes. This issue might also be related to issue 2.


4. I could live with all of this above but what I cannot live with is the spotty USB connection when running heavy workload or tabbing out of the game. This often results in the behaviour we saw on the Ryzen CPUs which got fixed. I often get complete sound loss on my USB DAC and my mouse/keyboard keep disconnecting occasionally. This also happens when running video over a separate DP cable (so only USB is used). 


I already tried several times to fix issue 4. without any success. New powerd hub, new USB-IF certified USB-C 3.1 Gen 2 cable... Nothing worked. 

Currently as a workaround I connect the USB-C to my motherboard and run the video over a separate cable. This however should not be the solution. If you include USB-C on your card, please make it be able to be used. Otherwise what's the point?

I used 2mm pads on memory and 1.5mm pads on VRM. The pads alone dropped memory temps 5-8C. Adding the heatsink reduced the temps further by 10C.


Starting memory junction temps while mining ETH were ~100C, now they are down to ~75C.


I also replaced TIM with ThermalGrizzly liquid metal Conductonaut. This resulted in ~15C lower gpu edge and hotspot. Just make sure to seal the resistors on the GPU package with nail polish or similar. I used Sally Hansen 7in1.

&amp;#x200B;

Like others out there, I'm suffering from FPS drops in games that are heavily CPU bound like CSGO. FPS can fall from 400 to 150 and back in about half a second, hurting gameplay in a very bad way.

&amp;#x200B;

As more and more reports are coming in, this is starting to look as a general issue. A few examples can be found below.

&amp;#x200B;

Games often mentioned are War Thunder, Rocket League, Fortnite and CSGO. Your typical CPU based games, that much is clear.

&amp;#x200B;

It looks like the CPU clock is all over the place in these kinds of games, causing the drops in frames. There doesn't seem to be any way to solve this and in many cases this has been going on for months. It's not limited to a specific card, as complaints are coming from all over the RX6000-series spectrum.

For reference: I have an RX6700XT myself, and my previous card (a VEGA 56) performed a lot better in games like CSGO than the new card. It had no drops in frames whatsoever, the RX6700XT is making games like CSGO a pain to play competitive.

&amp;#x200B;

In times where people pay crazy amounts of money to upgrade their GPU's, this is totally unacceptable. They can actually end up with lower performance on their favorite games. This is a major red flag.

Amd,B550 PCIe Lanes Exhausted or wrong Bifurcation ?,"Hello,

(first ever post for me on Reddit .. feedback apprecaited if i missed something)

**\*\*\* THE SETUP \*\*\***

Gigabyte B550 Vision D with F12 bios  
AMD 5950X  
PCIe Slot 1 x16 --&gt; RTX 3090  
PCIe Slot 2 x8 --&gt; ADWITS Quad NVMe with ASM2824 controller - server edition  
PCIe Slot 3 x4 --&gt; Aquantia AQN-107 - RJ45 10GBASE-T NIC

*(none of above is used for ""pleasure"" - i work in IT with virutalized environments and machine learning - all components were cherry picked for the purpose except MoBo (as consumer MoBo is a bit of ""unknown"" territory for me - I took random one on Amazon)*

**\*\*\* DETAILS \*\*\*** 

My NVME Raid Card do not require bifurcation. I used it in past in lot of servers as well as MacPro. Onboard chipset handles lanes and the card can work perfectly with x16 and x8 (also x4 but only with 2 nvme, although i need 4 for work purpose)

The 10Gbe NIC i bought is rated as PCI v3 x4, which is matching my motherboard specs.

**\*\*\* THE PROBLEM \*\*\***

My system do not recognize the added NIC card. 

If i remove the NVMe RAID card it works.   
A colleague of mine mentioned two options, either bifurcation or either lanes exhaustion.   
Although my RAID card do not need bifiurcation hence bios should not even bother ..  
In bios the bifurcation is set to AUTO 

Dunno what do to .. or even how can i check what is wrong as i don't get error messages or log.

Can anyone please help me understand if it is a matter of wrong BIOS setup ?   
Or if really exhausted lanes and should upgrade to x570 ?

Thank you in advance",False,11,0,1,0

I am gonna trade my RTX 2080Ti for a 6800 XT in a few days, and was wondering if I will still be able to capture in-game 360 stereoscopic images (for viewing in VR); similar to nVidia Ansel.

Of course, not having that is not a deal-breaker at all. I will take the 6800 XT anyway.

And also I do understand that at least for Ansel, it is something that the game's developers need to enable and implement.

But last time I had a Radeon was years ago. I am very much out of the loop so I thought I should ask.

It is just a nice secondary feature that I enjoy using on Witcher 3 for example.

With every Thursday drop, I reverse-engineered the Digital River web store a little more. At the end of three weeks of testing and coding, I had found a direct add to cart method that not only bypassed any anti-bot measures, but also exposed stock levels for the desired product. It was possible to run a script that used this vector from 10:20 AM to 11 AM on Thursdays without any pushback from any anti-bot measures. The moment the item was in stock, it could be added to cart.

A couple of weeks ago I reported the vulnerability to AMD cybersecurity and I'm excited to report that they have fixed the problem. Hopefully that's one less vector for scalpers to buy GPUs using bots. Good luck to everyone for upcoming drops!",False,231,0,1,0

Well any shop that wants to sell your video cards can't sell them, nor stock them: there is no competition, the only price drop are managed by you, like in a monopoly. This is definitely stuff to make Anti trust or other authorities notice but let's be honest.  


Check the markets listing: people buy your cards to resell them at 200 and more dollars mark [up.You](https://up.You) are inflating also illegal markets because I cannot and you cannot deny behind these people might be even criminals. In my country scalping tickets or products is a crime but of course ebay doesn't care, they don't even understand what a GPU is, who cares right?  


Do you care, why don't u stop supplying for some weeks and then send them to your retailers? They stopped buying them because you created this system that is eating itself and will keep doing so.  


I won't buy at scalped price from a drug dealer your card and I can't buy it as many others from your store. Do something, there are many solutions while this passivity, once a week is just making illegal activities bigger richer and more hungry. I may pass to Nvidia and intel too..   


There may even be nvidia people behind this pillaging of your cards, seriously do something

I'm curious if there's some unique reason to use LGA for server/workstation CPUs.

Amd,"A love letter to the 21.4.1 Radeon Major Drive Release. Thank you, AMD","I just wanted to make a post about this major driver release and the changes made to the Radeon suite itself. First, this major release was completely unexpected but very welcome. I love the three installation options Full, Minimal, or Driver only. People have been asking for this for years and now it's here. 

There are too many new features to go over, but I have to point out a few. I love the new subtle but noticeable simple design that can be found in every menu throughout the Radeon suite. There are now descriptions for each driver feature (with notifications if a game restart is needed after toggling on/off etc). 

The Color enhancement feature has been something I have been dying for. NVIDIA users have been using a similar feature for some time. I have been going into my display and changing the color saturation for my display. This would not get me the desired effect though. I love that I can just toggle it on and off per game (this feature is extremely helpful for games like Warzone).

   The menu is more organized and simple to navigate as well. Features and settings are now where I would expect to find them. Settings are no longer buried through several menus as well. I have friends and family that I game with that are playing on AMD systems and they are not as familiar with tech and have struggled with the software in the past. After helping a friend update yesterday he was able to find all the settings and features he was looking for without my help.

I would like to note that I was a very strong supporter of AMD Anti-Lag when they announced/released it and have had it on for some time. But recently (about two months ago) when trying to figure out why my Warzone gameplay felt laggy/stuttery I found that Anti-Lag was the cause. For example, when I am in-game I can toggle Anti-Lag from on to off and instantly see a difference. With Anti-Lag off my gameplay is smooth as butter. I don't know if this is because I am playing a competitive shooter at the highest framerate I can (around 140s for fps) and I notice it more than in other games or what. I have found keeping all of the extra features off like Anti-Lag and Image Sharpening and just turning on the new Vivid Gaming color enhancement feature I am happy and gameplay is smooth.

One more change I would like to mention. Thank you for finally updating that ugly tray icon/context menu icon. The software finally feels modern and minimal/solid.

His response was stunning, he went on a tangent about how AMD's prices are going to go up $400 in the next few months and to stay away from the 5600x because of the USB issues (they were fixed with bios). He told me about how he had a 5800x but returned it because he didn't want to wait for a BIOS update (?). He also told me to not go with the 3700x because of it's ""high memory latency"". The employee's recommendation that was heavily pushed on me was to buy an 11400f because it is the value king and AMD's prices are about to skyrocket (ok sure the 11400f is a really good value, but i didn't come in asking about that). When i told him I didn't want to go intel because im already on AM4, he put his little barcode sticker and we walked to the register as he told me how great intel is.

Amd,AMD Link has 3 serious problems! Cant be a parsec alternative (yet)...,"I hoped AMDs newest driver could improve my ""home-cloud"" setup and replace parsec, but I ran into 2 huge issues. 

Issue 0: 
You must have AMD-GPU hardware on your client, or else you cant use AMD Link. I got an Athlon 200G for testing.

Issue 1:
AMD Link does NOT work at first! Endless circle spinning, no error, it cannot connect at first. If you connect via rdp first it wont ever see the server again, you need to use parsec to be able to capture the display! If you use win-remote desktop again, you need to use parsec again. In the end, you´re still forced to use win-remote and parsec after boot.

Issue 2:
Server-Latency 27.xx+ !?! Whats the point of 30 or 60 fps, if the latency is ABOVE 33ms in a local LAN? Client ~6 ms is fine, Decoder 1ms, Encoder 10ms, Network 0,5ms all ok for H.264, but server-latency is 30+ms! Even at 720p@30fps total latency is above 45ms! Yes, latency even gets worse going from 1080p to 720p. 40+ ms on server! Playing a game with both AMD Link and Parsec open you can clearly see stuttering on Link. Parsec is smoother, but blurry.

Good Stuff 1:
Imagequality at high bandwidth is better than parsec. Less blurry, it uses full 50mbit, too. Parsec only uses like 10-15ish. Athlon doesnt support HEVC though, couldnt test H.265 on parsec client either.

All in all its a good start, but cannot replace parsec yet. I also still have huge issues with VFIO.

Amd,AMD RADEON RECORDING,"So last time I made a post how bad AMD encoder was on OBS, but after the new driver update 21.4.1 I thought of testing the radeon software to record my gameplay videos. And after that I am stunned today. At 50k recording bitrate using AMD RADEON software the clips are as sharp as h264 and nvenc. Now I have one question, why in OBS when I start recording using AMF it is such a muddy recording and in OBS whenever I go above 10k bitrate recording It drops thousands of frames but in RADEON SOFTWARE even using 50k bitrate keeps my recording smooth as well as smooth gameplay. I have rx 580 8GB GPU and obviously radeon software is not using my cpu otherwise at 50k bitrate my CPU will burst into flames with gaming. CPU R5 2600. Well from now on I am gonna use Radeon for recording instead of OBS.

Although I find default config a little weak and only good for rough approximation. Currently running prime avx in two threads mode. I figured max boost clock at ~73C (past that health management throttling kicks in) finds the most instability. I also added small scalar to keep cpu on the edge longer, for testing purposes only ofc.

The only complain I have is voltage balance heavily shifted towards multicore load, so max boost clock is always most unstable point on the curve, forcing you to reduce undervolt magnitude and pumping too much voltage at heavy multicore workloads. I tried to work around it by going weaker LLC settings (and adjusting magnitude accordingly), but results appears to be within margin of error, which is disappointing cuz I hate to have 80C+ on cpu.

I know, I know, this is nothing new, this CPU has been out there for a long time, everyone knows it's an efficient, low power chip blablabla.

The thing is, people still consider this chip as a slightly worse, slightly more expensive 3600 with iGPU. What people don't know however is that the 3600 is not really a 65w chip, but an 88w one. Even at the same PPT the 4650 will use less power.

I 'upgraded' from the 3600 a few days ago and I'm no longer throttling with a 45w PPT. Temps are waaay lower too. SoC temps are below 55 celsius while running cinebench which is kinda funny, because I'm using a $15 Alpine AM4 Passive cooler. Yep, no fans, just a small 500g aluminium block and that's it. Case is an NR200P, 2 case fans at 400-800 RPM depending on load. No other moving part.  


MT is 90+ percent compared to stock settings.  
ST is 95+ percent compared to stock settings.  


If you're building a render machine or you need some number cruncher for deep learning, scientific computation etc. then yeah sure, go ahead and buy a big case with big, loud cooling. For 'normal' PCs - including most gaming rigs - I just don't see the appeal of big hungry chips anymore.

Amd,Visible stuttering on my new 4K display in desktop with 5600XT. AMD doesn't respond to my tickets. Any help appreciated.,"Hi all,

since I got absolutely no response from AMD for months for two of my tickets, I'd like to get some help over here. I already tried /r/amdhelp and the tech support threads over here but I got no help either.

**I have this peculiar issue with my 5600XT since I upgraded my monitor to 4K:** I have visible stuttering while in desktop despite all measurments showing 60fps. Basically clicking through Windows, browsing, any animation/scrolling is visibly stuttering but when for example I start measuring performance in Firefox, it's showing solid 60fps. The stuttering is very obvious, it looks almost like 30fps, periodic fps drop many times per second.

**What can I do to shop this problem - if I do any of these actions then I don't have stuttering anymore whatsoever:**

1. run a game...any 3D game and my problems stop
2. play a video - even 360p youtube video and my problem stops, or a local mp4 file of any resolution - everything is suddenly smooth
3. connect a secondary monitor - even a fullHD monitor, then both of them are absolutely smooth
4. change display resolution to 1080p
5. boot a Linux distro, even USB booting without installing an Ubuntu and playing inside it was absolutely smooth
6. connecting a different GPU - I used my friend's R9 390 and I had no issue at all with it, same cable, same monitor input (displayport)
7. Start screen recording (from driver or OBS)

**What I already tried to resolve my problem:**

1. Obviously the GPU drivers...previous drivers, newer drivers, I'm currently on the latest 21.4.1 and the problem persists. I tried so many different drivers, DDUs, AMD cleanup utility, drivers over a year back, always the same problem
2. Clean Windows 10 installation - the issue appears since first boot, installing any driver doesn't help at all
3. Chipset drivers - same thing as with GPU drivers
4. BIOS - same as with drivers...new, old, reset, default, whatever. Also CSM/UEFI, doesn't matter.
5. Switching cables, switching between DP and HDMI
6. Enable/disable Freesync
7. I've switched GPUs with someone else - they have 0 issues with my GPU and I have 0 issues with their GPU R9 390
8. Change VBIOS on my 5600XT - I've bought the card soon after release and there were the new BIOSes available...I tried old/new and switching between perf and silent modes.
9. Power plans in Windows, Ryzen balanced/high perf
10. Disable freesync on display and in driver

**My hardware:**

Sapphire 5600XT Pulse

MSI Tomahawk MAX B450

Ryzen 3600

Monitor:  Asus  VG289Q

OS: Windows 10 Pro 20H2

&amp;#x200B;

**Guys, any help would be appreaciated.** I'm absolutely at loss and have no idea how to resolve this problem. Some time ago when I reported any issue to AMD they at least tried to help but now I reported my issue twice and they didn't reply. If you have and idea what can I change. I started to have this problem since the first moment I've connected the monitor few months back....at first I thought it's the drivers or the card, or chipset/bios...I have no idea anymore. It seems as if the GPU gets just barely loaded - as if with playing 360p video - it ""wakes up"" and everything is absolutely smooth.

I have also reported my problem to Sapphire but they responded right away to contact AMD.

**TLDR:** Sappire 5600XT Pulse + new 4K Asus VG289Q monitor have visible stuttering while in desktop but measurements show 60fps. Stuttering goes away immediately if I play a video (doesn't matter what quality) or run a 3D game or change resolution to 1080p. I don't have this problem in Linux or with a different GPU on same monitor. Changing cables and inputs doesn't help. Changing drivers doesn't help or clean Windows install doesn't help.

Amd,Ryzen 3600 dead,"Long post ahead just trying to burn off some frustration and steam   

Had a crazy thing happen to me a couple days ago. I was just chilling on my computer just watching YouTube and all of a sudden it shut down. 

Tried to power it back on and got nothing. So I started to look into it and removed both the power connectors off of my mobo and gpu and paper clip tested my psu and it would briefly click and turn back off. It would also click and turn off with the power switch turned to OFF. So great my psu had a catastrophic failure which is strange because it was a quality psu, EVGA 650 80 plus gold.  So I went and bought a new psu and still no dice. The psu is for sure good because I can paper clip test it and turn of my case fans, rgb, ect.  So now naturally I suspect the mobo,  gigabyte b450m ds3h, is toast too. Visually it looks okay but I RMA’d it to gigabyte and in the meantime I just went ahead and bought a new board, MSI B550 A pro, as well because I had been waiting to upgrade anyway.  

Fast forward to today and I swap my components over to my new board and it still doesn’t turn on, but if I remove the cpu from the socket everything will turn on fine and I simply just get the cpu debug led lit up.  I’ve tired everything from swapping in another known good gpu and tried a known good ram stick in every lane and still the only way I can get the mobo to power up is with the cpu removed. So my 3600 is dead right? Anyone else had a similar issue before? Unfortunately I don’t have another ryzen cpu to try out so I’m going to micro center in the morning to just buy another as a last ditch effort but was just wondering if anyone and ever seen a catastrophic PSU failure completely nuke a CPU",False,23,0,1,0

The FX 8350 when running games (same games am using the 5800x, for example Civ VI, Path of Exile, Last Epoch) used to cap out at about 55-57c temp but the 5800x goes up to 75-78c.

The thermal paste is fine, i checked it twice.

Are this temps normal for the CPU, they seem high to me.

Can someone help me please?

Amd,Risk in setting Infinity Fabric Frequency (FCLK) manually?,"I have the following system:

Ryzen 5 3600  
Asrock B450M Pro4-F  
2x16GB DDR4 PC3200 G.Skill Aegis  
Radeon 5700 XT  
UEFI version 2.7

XMP profile is active. I noticed in CPU-Z that the Northbridge (NB) frequency was exactly half of what the memory clock (MCLK) was. The MCLK is 1599.6 MHz (which seems correct for 3200 DDR RAM), but the NB frequency was only 799.8 MHz, which did not make sense to me, because my understanding is that MCLK should be equal to the NB frequency/FCLK.

In UEFI, the FCLK was set to AUTO. I manually set the FCLK in UEFI to 1600 Mhz. Now FCLK and MCLK are displayed as identical in CPU-Z (1599.6 MHz). The system seems stable and I ran a few benchmarks to compare. While not dramatically, the manual FCLK setting notably improves RAM and overall performance.

I am wondering now, if there could be any downsides/risks in having this manual FCLK setting. Is there any risk that this could damage components?",False,12,0,1,0

Amd,6900XT Red Devil Temps,"Hello,

Purchased a PowerColor Red Devil 6900XT to replace my GTX 1080 FE (full shroud, rear exhaust). It's been a very long time since I had a Radeon card and I'm using the Radeon Software to monitor the card while gaming. I've noticed that the Junction temp hits about 95ish and GPU temp about 79ish average at 98% + utilization with stock fan curves and no OC other than what it comes with out of the box. I know that the junction isn't really used as it is the die temp, but I'm a little concerned about the GPU temp and I'm wondering if my case/fan setup is adequate to support keeping this new card cool. The side panel right around the GPU itself does get quite hot, though definitely not too hot to touch or keep my hand on it indefinitely.

3x 140mm front intakes

1x 140mm rear exhaust

3x 120mm top exhaust (Kraken X62 360mm AIO) These are setup to pull air across the rad and up out of the case. 

Given the heat this new card puts out and the fact that my 8700k is not OCed, I'm debating replacing with an air cooler and putting 3x 140mm up top to help pull hot air out.

Amd,My first steps on PBO/Undervolting on my first ever Ryzen 7 5800X,"Hi fellow AMD fans and enthusiasts.

I recently built my first all AMD system for heavy workloads with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X after a lifetime of mid-tier non K Intel systems (last one still standing is an honestly very decent 6600 considering I didn't put much research when I built it).

I'm pretty new to the AMD stack and especially the whole PBO and undervolting tweaking so it was a big learning experience but I had some pretty good fun trying to understand how to optimize my system.

I hope my experience is somewhat educational to new guys in undervolting such as myself and if there are any errors please feel free to correct me and I'll rectify them.

Before I go one I wanna say a huge thanks to [this post](https://reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/khtx1o/guide_zen_3_overclocking_using_curve_optimizer) and its user, it helped me a ton!

As well as the AMD community in this subreddit, so many helpful and informative posts made this whole process a lot more fun than what I originally expected.


So here's my current situation, if you have any feedback about what I could improve or anything I should worry about let me know cause I'm really looking to learn more about such subjects. Tldr at the bottom.

Build: 
- Ryzen 7 5800X
- 32 GB G.Skill 3600Mhz CL16 - xmp profile, no manual oc, memory oc still scares me the most lol
- 360mm AIO deepcool mounted as top exhaust
- Corsair 5000D airflow case with 3 front 120 intake and 1 back 120 exhaust deepcool fans
- Aorus B550 Pro V2
- Aorus P850W gold psu

Out of the box my processor would hit 4.79 boost on its best core so I thought ""okay that seems really good, it's above the stated max boost clock.""
But I realized that all cores would not even clock at 4.3 boosted. 

I knew multicore is not supposed to boost as much as singlecore but barely 4.3 was honestly kinda disappointing as the reason I built this PC was for multi threaded applications for video editing so single core max boost didn't really matter to me. Hence I found out about undervolting and how it could potentially make all of my cores boost consistently higher in multicore scenarios while single core would probably still be somewhat the same (which I didn't care about).

I started tweaking the curve optimizer very conservatively, starting with -5 at each core and slowly going lower after stability testing. 

What I found really helpful was checking the MIN voltages of the VCore and VID in each core in OCCT because from what I understand the most common problem for an undervolt is system instability at low voltages when system is idle for long periods and needs to boost. 

I wasn't really confident with some of my best cores min voltages going as low as they did (below 0.9) so I ended up with the best 2 cores having the least undervolting and the worst having the most.
The curve for each core I ended up with is: best 2 at -10, next 4 at -20, second worst at -25 and the worst at -30.
I also have set +25Mhz OC offset and I actually **limited** the PPT to 125, the EDC to 105 and the TDC to 85 which to my surprise made performance better overall. Lastly I left scalar alone at the auto setting.

I have tested it for almost a month now with 0 crashes, 0 whea errors, left PC idle for days, left it to download from steam, left it literally doing nothing, run occt, cinebench, prime95 for hours and hours, I think I've tried everything I read about here and other forums so I'm almost positive it's ""fully stable.""

I'm still not 100% sure I understand how PBO 2.0 limits together with curve optimizer are supposed to work lol. The reason I limited those was that from my research I understand that if one limit hits 100% the others are wasted. I found out that hitting 125W would give the best performance/consumption so next I tried to find current limits to balance the thermals. From my testing 105A EDC seems enough for 99.9% usage cases to balance out said wattage. As for TDC I've never seen it above 90A when everything was set to auto so at 85A seemed to work out well.

With those settings Cinebench R20 went from around 5600 to 6100 in multicore and from 540 something to 610 in single core. I must have hit the reverse silicon lottery out of the box because from my understanding those were pretty poor numbers.

All 8 cores now hit 4.87 max boost consistently simultaneously (not for just a split second, but for 10+ seconds and then drop for less than a second and then back to max boost) and the effective clocks kinda impressed me considering it was pretty much only the 2 best cores hitting something like 4.4 after a few runs and all the others were trash, like around 4.0. Now all 8 hit 4.6+ consistently so I'm really happy with that result.
Max temps are 81-82C with an ambient of around 23C. That's in the worst torture test scenarios.

For gaming it doesn't go above 65C (again boosting all cores to 4.87 almost non stop) and idles around 35C but I have my case fans at a consistent 1000-1000 RPM that's not loud for me, they are what I would consider acceptable noise levels giving good airflow to both the CPU and the GPU.

Also VCore would spike to 1500mV but now it never goes past 1430 (from my understanding for split seconds that this happens it's not a problem and these chips are designed for such short spikes). When running cinebench before I would see VCore draw 1230+ while now it's around 1330+. As long as it's below 1400 even for long stretches of time it's not bad for the silicon health, is that correct?

Lastly I have my AIO pump at a somewhat aggressive curve (always idle at 40% and ramps up pretty quickly) but it's honestly really silent. The radiator fans were kinda noisy so I set them more conservatively but thermals remained almost unchanged so I think the pump does a pretty good job at normal workloads so fans are not needed to be super cool unless during stress tests and rendering/video editing.

Sorry if this was a long post and if the formatting is terrible, it just came to me that I wanted to post if for a few days and I'm always forgetting to so now so I started typing on my phone from memory while I'm away from my PC lol. I can provide screenshots if you are curious later.

TL;DR:

First AMD system, tried to educate myself and try PBO and undervolting because I thought out of the box performance and thermals were mediocre at best. My end goal is a stable system with better performance, not pushing everything to its limits. Ended up pushing all core boost to 4.87Ghz and with decent thermals and better consumption. Any feedback, comments, things to watch out for, mistakes/things I've misunderstood that might hurt the system long term are all welcome!

Amd,Can my Oculus Quest 2 run PC games with Integrated Graphics?,"&gt;Very good dear people. This time I have a question that has been puzzling me these last few days. The point is that I am going to buy some **Oculus Quest 2** (virtual reality glasses), and I plan to use them to play different games both on **PC** (VR Chat) and **natively** (the free games that are included). My question is:

*Can I run VR Chat (a virtual reality game for PC) with integrated graphics instead of a graphics card?*

Amd,My recent order was declined by Digital River for no apparent reason: some questions about what can one do to prevent this from happening?,"So after weeks of trying and probably somewhat helped by the odd turn of events in the last week drop (nothing came on thursday as usual, I shamefully waited until midnight to be sure and nevertheless prepared during the whole friday until the drop that surprisingly came at 21:00 Central european time), I successfully and smoothly ordered an RX 6800 and ultimately felt rewarded when I did (if you did too, you know what I mean, ""everything was not in vain"" and if your order went through: congrats!).

One hour after I received the ""order submitted"" email and unfortunately around 24h later I received an [""order situation"" email declining the order](https://i.imgur.com/Ct76E7l.jpg) (translation is pretty straightforward: it means ""thank you but NO"" basically), not giving any reason as well as a Paypal refund at the same time. Very disheartening.

Prior to ordering, I checked that everything was as clean as possible in the process: no VPN, no adblock, no script used, cookies cleared, etc. It was also my first order.

I paid with Paypal (I originally wanted to use CC but as I was already connected to my account I didn't want to lose anytime), as I did dozen of times before and never had an issue with it. My Visa card is confirmed in it as is my bank account and I have enough funds available in my bank account.

So digital River gives you an orderconfirmation@digitalriver.com to contact if you feel like this is a mistake. It's what I did and received what seems like a [generic, unhelpful answer two days later](https://i.imgur.com/6qhMvCd.jpg): ""Order \[\] has been declined because the information you entered was unable to be verified.  If you are still interested in the item(s), a new order will need to be attempted.  We have made a few minor changes in the system regarding your information and you may attempt a new order at this time."". The [same answer that this user received](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/mmz7ym/amd_declining_purchases_by_legitimate_customers/gtvkdab/) (also note that even if you receive a mail in your native language, as I figured, they seem to answer only in english, that's why I sent the email in two languages). According to this user they follow up by even more obscure explanations about how Paypal process authorization and how they are unable to verify the data. 

You don't know what they are talking about exactly, what can't they verify? what they did to remedy it? at the end of the day, very opaque.

**Now I'm just left hanging with questions as to how successfully order on AMD store and that's what I would like to ask the community:**

\- Should paying with Paypal be totally shunned? (if there are so many issues with it, why even propose it as payment method in the first place? It's literally the first time I hear about this authorization conundrum).

\- Does the fact that my address contains diacritics (such as 'é' and 'è' which are very common in french, the most common street name in france being probably something like ""Avenue du Général de Gaulle""; there is also the case of german eszett ß) could be an issue? (those works with paypal, no reason they shouldn't, but I noticed that the text field on AMD store will let you input them but won't let you go to the next step if you did).

\- My last name is written in two words so I usually write it in uppercase letters so that it's differenciated from my first name, could this be an issue? like they don't know what's my first and what's my last name?

\- Should I enter all info in uppercase letters without diacritics then?

\- About the phone number, should I add my country indicative? (like 00XX before the number, XX being the indicative).

\- Is it possible that they oversell and then are just out there declining orders?

\- Is there something different about european orders that should be taken into consideration?

\- They say they made ""a few minor changes regarding your information"" (whatever this means), does that mean I should reiterate with Paypal again if I have the chance to or going CC is the safer route anyway?

I know some of those questions sound ridiculous but here we are, Digital River seems very nitpicky, you don't know what to expect so it's better to maximize your chances and I can't believe I'm saying that so that I could buy a 600€ product. Somehow I also feel like I've wasted a big opportunity since this drop was the odd one out and I won't get a better chance in the near future.

&amp;#x200B;

On another note, is AMD okay with this way of proceeding? when I think about it, digital river are basically refusing money that was already given without a good explanation, acting like a bouncer and discriminating with their own rules that you don't know about.

Now I know that they will sell everything anyway but from my consumer point of view, I'm trying to buy whatever I can snatch first within my budget, so simultaneously trying to get either an RX 6800 or RTX 3070. If I could buy a 3070 instead, then it will be one less customer for AMD that was originally ""won"". And compared to a lot of people that I read, I'm not averse to using an AMD card in the first place as I have for more than a decade now since my last nvidia card was a 8800 GTX. I mean Digital River could at least try to reach out to you if there is an issue and put everything in order... or ask to put you on back order if you're willing to wait a bit... I don't know, the whole process is just so soul-sucking.

Thank you all for reading me.

Amd,X570 USB-disconnection - possible fix?," 

Hey guys,

As I've seen in the last few days, some of you still have the USB-disconnection issue on X570, just like I do. I now think that I've found something, that could cause that issue. It's the Corsair Commander Pro.

I'm currently using an ASUS Prime X570 Pro, which is known for having issues with the Corsair Commander Pro. To fix this, many of you did install a NZXT internal USB-Hub, just like I did. But from time to time, I still get the disconnects. I already swapped out my mainboard and still get the issues.

Now it gets interesting: I've installed USBDeview which showed me, that not every device gets disconnected. So I tried swapping out the USB devices on the back panel and waited for it to happen again. And again. And again. It turns out, that no matter how many devices I plugged in the back, it was always the same ports getting disconnected. And USBDeview showed me, that the Commander Pro was always one of them.

To test my hypothesis, that it's the Commander Pro, I swapped out the internal USB-header to which my NZXT hub was connected - and I got suprised, the Commander Pro and all the other internal peripherals that are connected to the NZXT hub got disconnected, but not the devices plugged in the back anymore! It seems like that the left USB header on the Prime Pro is not on the same lane as most of the back I/O, but one device on a port still got disconnected. It was a port that previosly wasn't affected by the disconnects.

As I read on the Corsair Forum, the Commander Pro only has USB 2.0, the newer ASUS boards seem to have no real USB 2.0 anymore, just some kind of adapted/downscaled USB 3.0 in form of a USB 2.0 header, which might cause that disconnection issue.

I will swap out my Commander Pro tomorrow to see if it's faulty, if the disconnects still happen I'll completely disconnect it and observe if those issues still occour.

If anybody has a similar setup and can confirm it, we maybe can talk to ASUS/AMD/Corsair to specifically fix that issue.",False,17,0,1,0

Amd,Lenovo legion T5 mb replacement,"TLDR: which b550 mb would you recommend? 
Preferably not msi and preferably fast @ releasing new bios versions, good uefi, good power delivery etc. Looks dont matter to me nor do i need wifi.

Full post: Like many others i wanted to build a new PC when zen3/ampere/rdna2 launched, and ofc thats almost impossible atm. 

Instead, I bought a prebuilt lenovo with a 3700X/3060ti. So far i've replaced the fans, cpu cooler, and ram. The stock cpu cooler was worse than the one intel used to include in the box, if thats possible. 

All good except.. the lenovo mb is a piece of proprietary garbage. 
You cannot control the fans, you cannot set ram timings (it does do 3600mhz thanks to ryzen master but with shit timings). The vrms audibly squeak at idle. The fan mount uses the intel hole pattern. Eww.

When I game, the gpu sounds like its gonna take off and the case fans barely do anything. This wont do.

So I need another matx b550 mb. I hate MSI and would prefer not to buy from them, other than that any brand will do. I prefer a usable uefi gui and timely updates/support over, say, onboard rgb. Looks don't really matter, its a closed case.

Amd,Reminder to clean out your systems.,"I built a PC with a 3900X last April. It’s being cooled by a 280mm NZXT AIO. 

Now due to the crazy past year I’ve had to move and have just been very busy (forced overtime to keep the hospital running etc) so the regular maintenance of my PC was neglected. After moving the PC had to be on the ground rather than a desk. It’s in a cooler master H500 with the mesh front and so it had REALLY good airflow etc so I didn’t worry about it to much 

I finally had some spare time to myself to reorganize my space and bought display port and active usb extensions so I could move my Pc across the room to a shelf off the ground.  

When I tell you that the dust blown out of the radiator fogged up the room I’m not even kidding. I wore a mask and had an air filter running to pull it all out of the air. The PC got a spa day cleaning and my idle temps fell from the mid 50’s to the mid 30’s on the 3900X resulting in better boost clocks too. Now under stress test it’s hitting high 70’s not high 80s with reduced clocks

Amd,6800 XT vs 6900 XT,"Hello guys.
I was able to get last week a 6900 XT at msrp after many tries trying to get a 6800 XT. I read somewhere that I should aim for the 690p xt instead since the 6800 xt is more popular, so thats what I did and I got it.
But I have been reading and watching benchmark videos and the difference between both cards are that crazy for the price difference.
Right now I owe a sapphire pulse 6700 xt, my question was should I keep trying to get a 6800 xt or keep the 6900 xt?

Amd,Who is to blame for the bad OpenCL Performance? Blender or AMD?,"I am a bit annoyed right now.

Around a year ago I got into Blender. Learning pretty much every aspect of it.

A few months ago my RTX2080ti died. Leaving me with the only escape of a 6900XT.

Dont get me wrong. I love the Card for gaming and VR sooooooo much. Silent and powerfull.

But with Blender? A complete HORRORSHOW!

Viewpoint GPU rendering was fast and snappy with CUDA or OptiX. With AMD and OpenCL? Slow to start and crashes/hangs alot.

Dont get me started on rendering itself. I had 3 Driver Crashes alone in the past week where I rendered everyday atleast once.

The funny thing tho... LuxCoreRender Standalone is fast as hell. Heck, even other 3D Programms with OpenCL Render like Cinema4D using U-Render is ultra fast and snappy.

A lot of people in the Blender Community shift the blame on the AMD Driver. But somehow I dont belive it. Other Programms can use OpenCL just fine. 

And on Linux? Wow. Blender just straight up does NOT work. Manjaro using the AMDGPU-PRO Drivers.   
Starting the Viewpoint Render just straight up crashes the whole Linux Distro. Deeplearning with OpenCL Backend and CryptoMiners wich use OpenCL work without an hitch.

Amd,Do you think Radeon and Nvidia will look at the sub-$200/$250 market again?,"The RX 480 and the GTX 1060 were truly the last of their kinds, with literally NO new (the 1660, 1660S, 1660Ti, 580, 590, 5500XT etc are all literally single digit % improvements over each other) generational leap in that $200-$250 price segment.

Till today we've been getting refreshes after refreshes, and even though the 1660 and the 5500XT were an architectural jump, the performance was THE SAME in the SAME price segment.

The rumored RTX 3050 and the 3050Ti are shooting slightly above the RTX 2060 perf, and we don't even have anything more than that as of yet. No word on low end RDNA2 SKU's either, apart from that 6600XT and 6500XT rumors.

What I'm asking here (taking the last 1660S and 5500XT's price and TDP into context), is that will we be getting a low end Ampere and RDNA2 SKU's like, probably an RTX (or just GTX without RT) 3030 and an RX 6300, with a TDP of under or at board power (~75W), performance ~ RX 580 / GTX 1660, with a minimum 6GB VRAM, aimed at the 1080p / eSports audience which both these companies have marketed to in the past via their PR.

I get that the only spike in price could be that 6GB of G6 VRAM. But can AMD and Nvidia afford a $100-$130 SKU like this today, like they have traditionally did in the past (GTX 950, 1050, RX 460, 560 etc,)? Will they even care?

Amd,My GPU Thermal Material Replacement Venture (Great Results),"I have an MSI RX 5700 XT Mech OC, and it was suffering from some pretty severe thermal issues. Before I did anything, under load, the GPU would hit 110 C junction temperature almost immediately and throttle, delivering very sub-par performance.

I decided to give replacing the thermal material a test, and I wound up with phenomenal results.

TEST CONTROLS:

In both scenarios, ambient temperature was 19 C. All case fans and the GPU fans were locked to 100%. Temperatures and clocks were measured over the course of one 3DMark TimeSpy run. The GPU was underclocked to 1800 MHz and undervolted to 950 mV for both runs.

BEFORE:

||*Max Thermals* *(deg. C)*|
|:-|:-|
|GPU|51|
|Memory Junction|78|
|VR VDDC|49|
|**Hot Spot**|**112**|
|VR SoC|46|
||*Results*|
|TimeSpy Overall|7856|
|**TimeSpy GPU**|**7777**|
|TimeSpy CPU|8339|

As you can probably guess, the hot spot temperature was holding the card back. AMD's limits are 110 C, so a result of 112 is way hotter than anticipated. As a result, the real clocks (with a target of 1800 MHz) were erratic and bouncing anywhere between 1150 and 1756 MHz, not ever even able to hit 1800 MHz. Remember, this is with a *considerable* undervolt! Why might that be? Here's a look at MSI's poor thermal-interface job (before my modifications):

https://preview.redd.it/l90xnoq0u0u61.jpg?width=2601&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=143cd9cd372615f99c0bd7d0424eb3657c7a091f

It might be a bit difficult to see, but there are some spots without *ANY* thermal grease! The thermal pads aren't ideal either (they don't cover the entire chip) but that shouldn't make too much of a difference because they do cover the middle.

I replaced the thermal pads (again, perhaps not necessary) with Thermalright's Odyssey 2.0mm and the thermal compound with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut.

AFTER:

||*Max Thermals* *(deg. C)*|
|:-|:-|
|GPU|52|
|Memory Junction|70|
|VR VDDC|53|
|**Hot Spot**|**95**|
|VR SoC|47|
||*Results*|
|TimeSpy Overall|8774|
|**TimeSpy GPU**|**8860**|
|TimeSpy CPU|8319|

*Significant* improvement! In fact, if I'm willing to get a bit testy with the 110 C limit, I could push clocks and voltage even higher. 

CONCLUSION:

MSI have done a rather poor job with this card, and the MSI RX 5700 XT Evoke seems to be affected as well. If you have either one of these cards, it's almost a requirement to do some thermal material replacement. Otherwise, you'll be getting performance comparable to a 5600 XT. I'm very happy with my results, and would recommend that anyone (especially people with MSI cards) should do this.

(Please realize that there are risks! The process is fairly safe overall, but it is possible to damage your card. Also, if you're not in the US, this process WILL VOID YOUR WARRANTY. Do this at your own risk!)",False,10,0,1,0

Amd,AMD is laughing at Intel in the server department,"I've got tasks that need CPU power. Just a couple of days ago, I bought two 7702 Epycs from Mindfactory for 3966€ each. At the moment, threadripper pro costs approximately 5500e. The 7702s boost to 2.45GHz, while consuming less than 200W.

Why did I buy two 7702 and did not go for 3rd gen Epyc?

* Price. 7702 costs 3966€. 7763 more than 9000€. 7713 is a bit cheaper
* Power: 200W vs 280W. 
* From a performance per watt perspective, the 3rd gen epyc is faster at most by 5% (see the analysis by anandtech [https://www.anandtech.com/show/16529/amd-epyc-milan-review/5](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16529/amd-epyc-milan-review/5))

Some reviewers publish at the end a geomean of all results and make conclusions. However, if you take a subset of the tests that really can utilize 128 cores, the conclusions are much different. Overall, these CPUs are very close in applications that fully utilize all the cores. 

Basically, the IO Die eats additional 50-60W than the zen 2 IO die. This fact basically removes most of the performance gains. In fact, we have seen from the mobile parts that AMD is in fact able to produce much more efficient IO logic and I guess that when they get any competition from Intel, they are simply going to ramp up the io die to the newest process, bring down its consumption from 100W to 25W and thereby increase the all core boost frequency by 1Ghz. Even with no other architectual improvements, they would still kick ass. 

If we get a zen3 threadripper, it will either have TDP higher than 280W (unlikely), be extremely well binned (unlikely) , have the zen3+ IO die, or there will be no zen3 threadripper. 

Any opinion on that?

For myself, I can thank zen 3 epycs for the wonderful price cuts of the 7702. The performance I've got for 14k € is simply mesmerizing (2x7702, 1TB of Rdimm 3200Mhz, 1xSn850 2TB, 3x 3.84TB SN650, 2x x18 18TB Seagates, with the gigabyte mainboard, case and a psu).",False,98,0,1,0

Amd,Do I really need the Ryzen 7 3700x boost?,"Hi guys, I recently got myself a PC with Ryzen 7 3700x in it. Everything works fine with 16GB 3200MHz RAM and Gigabyte B550 MS3H motherboard. The only problem were CPU the temperatures, these could go up to 50-55 degrees while watching youtube videos and up to 62-65 while playing Apex Legends on low/medium settings (the only thing that I didn't change in my pc was the GPU which is a 2GB Radeon so I can't play any new games on Ultra settings). I did some research and found a thread on Reddit in which people said that capping max processor usage at 99% in ryzen balanced power plan will fix the issue. Well, it did, now my CPU temps don't go over 50 degrees (even when playing games) and the CPU voltage is somewhere around 0.98V. The only problem is that the clock is now stuck at 3,6 GHz. I wanted to ask you guys, if there's any use of those random 4,3 GHz boosts (with max CPU usage set on 100% in the power plan settings)? I mostly use my PC for programming/playing games but I don't really see the difference between using this CPU with 100% and 99% max power settings. I'm pretty sure that it would make a difference if I wanted to play some games like Cyberpunk in 4k on ultra settings or stream some games on Twitch etc but my GPU won't allow me to do that any time soon. I'm thinking about using these settings untill I buy a better GPU and then I will also start thinking about getting a better CPU cooling and maybe OCing the CPU. Which preset do you guys use: the max 99% or max 100%, can you tell the difference between working on these two presets (because I dont tbh)? Or maybe there's some way to make my CPU work on lower voltages and frequencies and boost to 4,3GHz only when needed? (cuz right now with max cpu power usage set at 100% it randomly jumps from 3,6GHz(0.9V) to 4,3GHz(1.2-1.3V) even when I'm not doing anything at all, thats why the temperatures are so high).",False,20,0,1,0

I did a bit of research, but still have some doubts. It is said that to safely disable csm your boot drive needs to be in a gpt partition or it won't boot. But saw some claims that if you have csm enabled by default, that means the os is an mbr partition and the bios is in a legacy mode.

I have 2 sata ssd. The boot drive is in a separate ssd and it is a gpt partition. But the other ssd is an mbr partition. I checked in msinfo (system information) and it is said that the bios mode is UEFI.

Is it safe to disable the csm? It was enabled by default. Additionally context, I just replaced my r5 2600 from gigabyte ab350n itx to asrock b450 steel legend and then replaced it with 5600x without reinstalling windows.

Amd,"My experience with 5900x RMA through Memory Express Canada, originally paid $862CAD but only got $640CAD back","I'm here to share my experience online, I'm don't usually post but I just feel robbed by this whole situation.

**February 26th, 2021**

I managed to purchased a 5900x from Memory Express in the West Broadway location in Vancouver, Canada. Pretty excited at that point, as it was one of the last pieces I needed for my new build. I'm located in Vancouver so I was gathering parts from Memory Express, Canada Computers and Newegg.ca in the month of January and February. 

I noticed something off when I was at the counter, I asked for the CPU and the staff brought over an BNIB 5900x. He then insisted on having to open the product in front of me and check the pins and make sure that none of them are bent. I was a little hesitant but let him do it anyway. he then put it back in the box and put a tape over the box and we made the transaction.

Total cost was: $862.39 CAD after tax.  


**The week of March 15th**

My computer went BSoD through out the week, and eventually I couldn't even make it into Windows. I tried to troubleshoot it on my own but without success.  


**March 22nd, 2021**  
I took it to the computer store near me ""Canada Computers"" diagnostic. Technician contacted me the next day and told me that the CPU is detective and recommended me to take it back to Memory Express for a replacement or a refund.

On the same day I took the product back to Memory Express. The staff was reluctant to give me a refund or and exchange, he took the product away and came back and started accused me of damaging the product by showing me the pins that were bent; which the Canada Computer technicians and myself have never seen before (especially they would've called me out on it during their diagnostics if I happened to bent it in the first place).

I've tried to reason with the staff at Memory Express but they were really reluctant to help, in the end I got them to send the product back to the manufacturer for diagnostics.

The staff told me that the process will take 4-6 weeks, he also said that either I would get a replacement product back or credit from which would go back to my credit card.

&amp;#x200B;

**April 16th, 2021**  
Memory Express called and said that they couldn't replace the product and that they will give me the credit.

**April 17th, 2021**  
I went to Memory Express next day and the staff said that I was only eligible for a refund of $640.28 CAD. They refused to give me the remainder amount, saying that they're not responsible for any refund or credit amount because that amount is provided based on the manufacturer. 

Refund: $640.28 CAD

So where did the $222.11 CAD go? That's my ultimate question for this incident. Was the full amount not provided by AMD to reimburse the customer? Or did Memory Express pocketed the remainder? Where do I go from here and how do I get my money back?

  
It is not my fault a defective product was sold to me through Memory Express. I paid for the product at full amount in good faith. Memory Express are not taking responsibility for selling faulty goods to their costumers while accusing their costumer for damaging the product in the process.

AMD knew that the product was defective through RMA hence the refund credit that was sent back to Memory Express to reimburse me, but the remainder amount was withheld from me.

At the end of the day, I just want a product that works but this experience is making me questions a few things.",False,49,0,1,0

GPU: ASUS ROG Strix 5700XT

PSU: Corsair RM750

NVME: Corsair MP600 500GB

HDD: Iron Wolf 3TB

RAM: Corsair Vengeance RGB 2x8GB 3200mhz CL16

Case: Corsair Obsidian 750D Airflow Edition

So firstly, used to have an MSI RTX 2080 Ventus, then sold it and used an EVGA GTX 1060 3GB until I found a reasonable replacement. Found the 5700XT for a great price and bought it second hand. When it arrived, it literally is brand new. Box is perfect, no dust anywhere, no scuff marks anywhere. Looks great. So I did a clean install of windows, and downloaded all my apps. Downloaded AMD drivers, left them all on default didn't really mess around with them. Played Hell Let Loose for an hour or two, no problems. However... when I went to play Call of Duty Cold War... all hell broke loose.

Booted up the game, went to join a multiplayer game. While downloading the shaders, my computer restarts. Weird. Thought I'd give it the benefit of the doubt and rebooted, and loaded up COD again. Same thing happens. After doing this a few more times, I started monitoring the temperatures to see if anything untoward was happening. Temps seem fine. Could not get past the shaders download with a reset.

So then I turned to the internet to see if I could find a quick solution. I basically stayed up until 5am, trying every solution possible on multiple threads... from changing BIOS settings, updating to latest BIOS, praying to the GPU gods, re-installing drivers, uninstalling drivers, changing all sorts of settings within the Radeon software. Nada. Call of Duty is just a no go. So let's try some other games... Weirdly, Division 2 ran great, no resets and really nice FPS. Temps were normal. Marked that game off as ok. Tried Enlisted, reset my PC after 5 minutes. At this point I was monitoring all the temps and it seems like when GPU JUNCTION TEMP on the Radeon overlay gets over 72C+, the PC reset. Tried Enlisted with fans set to 100%, worked fine. But the noise... oh jesus. Fans so loud. Tried BF5 with 100% fans, reset my PC. What I did notice was, when my PC restarted the RGB profile for BF5 was still active on my keyboard. I don't know what that means. Does that mean anything to anyone else?

So all in all, I've tried a lot of different options here but I'm running out of patience. Can anyone shed any light on my plight? My partner has an i7-8700 rig which I might try the GPU out on later, but if it works fine I don't really want to trade out my brand new AMD build for her old trashy Intel build. Considering trying to resell it, as even if I put it £50 less than the lowest ebay listing, I will still be making over double profit. Please flood me with ideas and hope!

Yours sincerely. Guy with annoying GPU.",False,39,0,1,0

Amd,5950X Motherboard that Compares with 10th/11th gen Intel,"This will be my first AMD build and I am having a hard time finding an ATX AMD MB that compares to my existing Intel board. I am probably overlooking an obvious solution or hadn't considered a brand because I am unfamiliar with them.  

Right now I have a ROG STRIX Z590-E GAMING WIFI. I like the 4 M.2 with 5 SATA ports (m.2\_4 disables SATA\_2), front USB 3.2 gen 2x2 front header, WiFi 6E\*, and that I can disable all lights (both RGB and functional lights) in the bios. I have nothing against LEDs, but I need to be able to turn all the lights off (even system LEDs) when I am working, else it distracts me. 

One thing that has annoyed me about the Strix is that because it only has one USB 3.2 gen 1 header I can only use two of the four front USB ports. My 5950X will be going inside a Lian Li o11D XL, and I'd like to have all 5 of the front USB all working.

I can't find a board that is the same as the Strix and has two USB 3 front headers on an AMD build. I have had good luck with Intel Asus boards and so my first thought was the Asus ROG Strix X570-E Gaming or the Dark Hero, but they only have two m.2 and 1 USB 3 header. I have also considered going with MSI Meg X570 Unify but I am worried about the limited number of rear USB ports. Both of these issues could be solved with an expansion card, but I would like to avoid having a PCIe card between the bottom intake fans and the GPU both for airflow reasons and for aesthetics. Also, at least with intel MB, adding a second PCIe card drops the GPU from x16 to X8. And while it's unlikely to have a huge impact on my 3080, it might cause issues with the 4080.

Cheaper, of course, is better but a board that meets my needs is more important than price.

Any help would be wonderful.

It used to run flawlessly 100-120 fps @1440p and most of the time it is still very smooth. But it feels like every few minutes or so I'll see my frames literally half for a second, before they recover, resulting in really intrusive stutter, however brief. But in PvP it can cost.

  


For weeks I've been convinced it was a Bungie issue, or a Nvidia one. But now I'm beginning to wonder if an expensive cpu upgrade might be the only solution. Or is it something else? See, my 3300X does not give me problems, normally. It's seemingly still quite capable and relevant, up to now.

  


Am I barking up the wrong tree or could my CPU suddenly be feeling the burn in an updated D2 engine? How many cores does this game even use?

  


From my research, the fact that I play at 1440p resolution means even a high end Ryzen chip would see only marginal improvements with card. 1080p is where the 5600x and higher yields results, but 1440p and 4K seems to place most of the Ryzen chips plainly in the same ballpark in terms of actual game frame rates.

As usual 5900x has huge demand and retailers are selling it for extra price compared to actual price. Instead of paying extra for 5900x, I thought of getting 5950x which is almost close to actual price and finally got one.

I’ve been looking into AMD as a replacement for Intel, since I’ve recently heard a lot of really good things about them. Thing is, since this is basically my first time doing any research regarding AMD processors, I’m fairly confused with what I see in the usual Google search.

For example, I can easily understand Intel processors, or at the very least, I can understand that i7 is better than i5, which is better than i3, etc. The problem for me, is that I can’t do the same thing with AMD as easily, outside of the Ryzen processors (and I’m not even sure if I’ve understood the Ryzen as well as I think I have).

* CPU: AMD Athlon X4 860K
* GPU: RX 560 4GB
* RAM: 8GB

His processor is super weak and he wants to upgrade it. He gave me 3 choices.

* Ryzen 7 2700 8c/16t 3.2Ghz-4.1Ghz for 180+ usd (Used)

Productivity, and streaming isn’t really a concern and I was all set to pull the trigger on 5600x + 4000 mhz cl 16 ram when a thought occurred that maybe spending €200 on just 16gb of ram was not the greatest idea… 5600x (€360) 16gb 4000mhz cl16 Ram (€200), or a 5800x (€460) and 16gb 3200mhz cl16 (€100). They work out at the same price. Unfortunately, ram options with lower latency are wildly more expensive or just plain not available. Or over 3600mhz they are cl18,19 and above. 3600mhz CL16 is completely unavailable, or sold out with no idea for stock arrivals.



I’m purely chasing the smoothest, fastest experience at 1440p and 144hz within reason. So, I didn’t think 32gb of lower speed ram would serve this aim any better.

I put my Ryzen 1700 that was collecting dust to use few weeks ago and noticed Docker instance crashing. Sometimes few times a day, sometimes once a few days. I thought my RAM is unstable and set it to stock 2400 MHz but even that was crashing. After a while it clicked. I remembered that 1st gen Ryzens had manufacturing defect that caused segfaults on Linux and Docker runs on WSL.

Long story short AMD denied replacement and I'm stuck with segfaulting Ryzen 1700 on both WSL and Linux. I don't mind starting background script that will check every 1 min if Docker instance is up or not and restarting if necessary but I'm worried that the data might get corrupted.

So... Can the data get corrupted or is it crashes only? If any of you know how I can reason with AMD support to get a replacement, feel free to share any info or details. My understanding is that segfaulting issue is manufacturing defect and they should have recalled all faulty CPUs in the first place.

I tried to ignore it until the other day, when my frames were going especially low, I noticed in the settings that minecraft was using a built in Intel UHD 360 gpu instead of my supposedly powerful AMD Radeon RX 5700.

I was a bit disappointed that the game in which I had probably logged hundreds of hours in hadn't been using the gpu that I specifically bought for the game, but I figured it wouldn't be that hard to get minecraft to use the amd gpu.

I did a little research and figured out that these types of GPU's don't really support OpenGL games like minecraft. I tried to reinstall the drivers but it didn't fix the issue. Is there a specific way to get my GPU to work with OpenGL games or do I have to buy a new GPU altogether? (Minecraft is basically the only game I play, so there's no point keeping a gpu that doesn't work for it)

I also ran the dxdiag command in the windows run thing and the graphics card that was listed was the built in Intel card instead of the AMD card:

This leads me to believe that maybe the problem is something different than the card not supporting OpenGL? I'm honestly not sure, I'm not that good at tech. Let me know if you know anything about this issue, or how to fix it. I am fine with buying a new gpu and selling the one im currently using, so if that is the best option let me know.

I've read about plenty of cases where people can't get to 4200mhz due to temps going over 75, I seem to have the other end of it, it doesn't want to lower the speed.

It'll lower at idle, like at under 5% load but at anything more it just goes full beans and the temps really spike.

Part 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/mpcyj1/update_yes_they_did_and_it_doesnt_end_there_did/

TL;DR of previous posts: I filled out the form on AMD's website for RMA of a Ryzen 7 PRO 4750G APU (without knowing that supposedly these chips aren't covered by warranty). RMA got approved. I sent in the APU (prepaid shipping label) to AMD's partner in Miami, FL, USA, ModusLink. I got an email saying RMA passed inspection and RMA completed. Then got emails saying RMA replacement will be 3700X, with option for 3400G APU. Original APU I sent in was destroyed and couldn't get it back, so I was stuck, since they couldn't replace with an OEM/tray product.

After writing a nice but strongly worded email to AMD's RMA department, and having /u/AMD_Gary reach out to me via DM and escalate the case, I received a call within 24 hours from AMD (phone number from Netherlands, even though I'm in Canada).

They said they will replace my 4750G I sent in with another new 4750G as an exception, since this RMA should never have been approved in the first place. I received the replacement today and it is indeed a Ryzen 7 PRO 4750G, which is what I sent in, and works great in my system!

Thanks everyone for your support throughout my previous posts! I appreciated every suggestion that was made on how I should go about rectifying this.

Special shoutout to AMD for admitting to their mistake and making things right, in the name of customer satisfaction. Finally a happy ending to a month-long RMA process!",False,35,0,1,0

**UEFI BIOS update list noted below – A total of 41 boards with a UEFI BIOS update.**

**W15 is in relation to the workweek, these updates were released between the April 9th – April 16th**

***Why is my motherboard not listed?***

If you are looking for your motherboard/model I would suggest going to https://www.asus.com/us/support/ and checking if it has been updated recently. I post updates on a weekly basis. UEFI’s are released in waves, because of this it can take an entire series weeks or months to see the “same” update if it includes items like CPU firmware. Furthermore, keep in mind that not all updates are applicable to all models. Due to inherent design differences as well as specification and feature variation an update may only be applicable to a specific model.

***How can I be notified about releases?***

If you want to be kept in the loop, you can also follow me for notifications when updates are released/posted. I am also the admin for our PCDIY Facebook Group where I post updates and other ASUS centric product news https://www.facebook.com/groups/ASUSPCDIY

***How long after a board is produced will UEFI updates be released?***

Keep in mind that generally after a year a motherboard reaches a certain maturity level and as such will see fewer updates. If you feel you have an issue that is dependent on a UEFI release, please submit a support ticket. In some cases, some boards can see updates for more than 24 months+

***I want to update but am not sure how to update the UEFI ""BIOS""?***

If you want guidance on how to flash/update your UEFI BIOS please watch the video linked below.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scK8AP8ZACc

***Should I update the UEFI if my system is stable and running without issue?***

If your system is running without issue, especially if overclocked in any way ( including DRAM ) it is advised you stay on the build/release you are on. Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can change the OC experience and require you to retune a previously stable OC value. This does not mean the UEFI is not a functioning release but that changes in the underlying code base need to be accounted for when tuning a system. As many of these values are in low level or specific operating parameters it is best to retune from full UEFI defaults after you have re-run stability test at UEFI defaults.

***What if the UEFI BIOS listed is a BETA? Should I update?***

BETA UEFI releases are for enthusiasts who want access to the latest features, functions, and microcode enhancements, and overall UEFI improvements. As they are not officially supported, they are not recommended for day-to-day / long-term use. Users who plan to use their system in this capacity and want to ensure the best interoperability/compatibility and stability, as well as performance, should wait for a formal release.

***Will a UEFI ""BIOS"" update improve the performance of my system?***

A UEFI update can include CPU microcode as well as other performance tuning adjustment enhancements for the UEFI that can influence/increase performance. With this noted it is generally minimal. As always performance analysis/comparisons should be done at stock-to-stock values. This means loading F5 on both releases and comparing your application/benchmark scores. OC-related comparisons may require retuning prior to testing as changes to underlying auto rules can invalidate prior scores even if with similar settings.

***Not every user should update/flash their UEFI BIOS. I stress this again, if you are running without issue(s) you are advised to stay on the release you are running.*** 

***Notes to consider -***

***\* When flashing please perform the update process at full UEFI defaults. Do NOT flash with an overclocked system/profile.***

1.I recommend updating the UEFI BIOS on your motherboard for new PC builds. This helps to ensure the best interoperability, compatibility, and performance. If you are building a PC and have not yet installed the OS, I would recommend you update the UEFI.

2.Keep in mind flashing/updating the UEFI will reset all defined parameters/settings and operating profiles. You will not be able to restore defined values by using a UEFI Profile as profiles are not interoperable between builds. It is advised you note or screenshot (F12) your values prior to flashing if they are complex. Upon completing a flash, I would recommend you load UEFI defaults after the fact and complete a full reboot and shutdown prior to re-entering your prior values. Keep in mind you may need to retune these values under a new UEFI.

3.When you update the UEFI and re-load UEFI defaults depending on your originally defined CSM/UEFI device parameters you may experience BOOT issues. Depending on prior settings you may need to enable or disable CSM to restore BOOT functionality.

4.Be advised that in some cases a rollback to a prior UEFI is not possible. This generally is the case when there is an update that includes CPU microcode (such as an AMD AEGSA or Intel ME). This means you may not be able to “flashback” to a prior release.

5.While not always necessary some UEFI updates may require a clearing of the CMOS. You can either clear the CMOS via the CLR CMOS button if your motherboard has this feature/function or you can also CLR CMOS by removing the onboard CMOS battery for at least a few minutes. You can also attempt to locate the CLR CMOS jumper on the motherboard and short the pins.

6.In some cases, you may not be able to jump from an older UEFI release to a much newer release. You may need to ""step"" update, this will mean upgrading incrementally to a slightly newer build first prior to going to the most recent build/release. In most situations this not required.

I also recommend you backup your system prior to any flash/update and always advise flash/update become executed from a fresh loading (F5) of UEFI defaults.

The board model/name is on the right-hand side and the version number is on the left-hand side. To download the UEFI BIOS please go to https://www.asus.com/support/

On first boot, I observed temps of 60-70c at (supposedly) idle. Today they’ve come down slightly at 45c idle, although when in the BIOS menu they’re still higher at 60c. I reckon yesterday’s first boot was not actually idling, so probably around 45c is an accurate number. Why would it be higher in the BIOS menu?

I ran Prime95 and it reached 95c in 10 mins so I stopped the test. Is this too high combined with 45c idle temps? My precious, very old i5 3450 managed 28c idle and 70c load.

We need this same ability for Radeon Relive, as writing to SSDs or HDDs 24/7 is pointless and a waste of resources and will possibly even negatively influence drive longevity.

Imagine you could activate Radeon Relive for some specific games only, instead of having it enabled system wide. Relive would then automatically start recording your replay to cache when starting that game.

Amd,Question about PBO scalar x10,"I've been playing around with my 3700x settings, I realised that when I set scalar to x10 I start getting that juicy 4.4Ghz more often than stock and I'm happy with performance, I also have LLC set to mode 3 on my MSI x570 MPG Gaming Plus, voltage doesn't exceed 1.490mv on light loads (same as scalar x1), max temp was 50c, please note that I use CTR hybrid profile for multicore tasks so whenever the CPU usage exceeds 30%, the profile activates and it sets to 4.3Ghz all cores at 1.325mv then at 80% it sets to 4.15Ghz at 1.244mv.

So I made sure that stock settings with scalar x10 only runs on light loads like gaming.

In the current market I wont be able to change to nVidia (and even if cards were availiable, I dont have the money to buy another one), so I need to get it to work. 

The goal is to get TensorFlow working on the 6800. As far as I can tell from my research, I have the follwing options:

1. ROCm, but it seems BigNavi isnt officially supported (but can be made working if I believe this article [https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=amd-rx6800-opencl&amp;num=1](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=amd-rx6800-opencl&amp;num=1)?) and I need to setup a Linux to use it
2. PlaidML, but this would limit me to Keras and not true Tensorflow
3. TensorFlow with DirectML ([https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/win32/direct3d12/gpu-tensorflow-windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/win32/direct3d12/gpu-tensorflow-windows)), with the Drawback it doesn't use TF 2.x

Amd,What exactly happened yesterday,"So, as I am sure most of you are already well aware, yesterday there appeared to have been preparation for AMD to sell some stock of their products through the amd direct store, but no products ever went into stock. First a short timeline of events:

All relevant timestamps will be in CEST(Central European Summer Time)(UTC+02:00)  


For most of the afternoon the AMD Ryzen 9 3900x was ""available"", with the requirement to pass a reCaptcha before adding anything to your Cart. This reCaptcha failed 4/5 times, because of a 503 backend error.(at least to my knowledge)

At around 16:30 the Digital River backend slowly started listing the products which were subject to be sold. This list included:  
AMD Radeon RX 6700XT

AMD Radeon RX 6800

AMD Radeon RX 6900XT

AMD Radeon RX 6800XT midnight black edition

AMD Ryzen 7 5800x

AMD Ryzen 9 5950x

Not Included were:  
AMD Radeon RX 6800XT(Normal Version)

AMD Ryzen 5 5600x

AMD Ryzen 9 5900x

&amp;#x200B;

The nothing happened until around 19:21 when captchas started appearing again, but still not properly authenticating, likely due to an insufficient backend. This is where I believe they planned to release the stock, but the backend was not properly configured so it didn't happen. Around 20-30 minutes after the captchas started to appear they were no longer available. This then persisted throughout the entire night with virtually no indicators or updates on anything.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now its the morning, I slept a grand total of 5 hours and 30 minutes and am trying to figure out what in the name of the holy flying spaghetti monster happened here.  


My personal theory is that the sale was supposed to happen at 19:21 but they had issues with the backend so they stopped the sale. The question now is, will they release the stock today, later this week, or keep it stored for a larger drop next week.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall my issue with the current situation is not even the fact that there were issues with the backend. I know how difficult it can be to operate a good backend. But rather my issue is with the complete and utter lack of communication on these sales. If the best source of information on the release of a product can be found through a variety of discord servers, unintended backend API requests and an obscure german hardware forum's best attempt at getting any information out of AMD then there is a very clear lack of official communication.

Amd,Impossible to liquid cool 5950x even with 10 fans?,"For the past months I've been struggling to keep my PC chilled and cool, and the results haven't been impressive. For the record, I have a 5950x cooled by a NZXT Kraken z73 in a Lian Li O11 Dynamic XL case. My CPU temperatures at first were jumping around the 70s to 80C, obviously creating a ton of heat in the case, while my AIO liquid sat at 45C. This also resulted in my platter harddrives getting very toasted, reaching temps of 56C. My GPU (1080ti) was also reaching the high 70s too. Since then, I've managed to lower the temp of my CPU by bringing its core voltage down to 1.1250V, which during heavy workload at max saw 62C, so that was a win. Meanwhile, I undervolted my GPU so now the highest it goes is now 72C. However, my liquid temps didn't change, at all. I had 9 fans in my Lian Li case, originally 3 bottom as intake, while the 3 sides and top 3 AIO served as exhaust. However, I've recently changed my side fans to intake as well which did slightly help but not by much. I then went ahead and changed my AIO fans, as I was using Corsair QL for those and was suggested by some that those are terrible radiator fans. I since swapped them with Corsair ML Pros, and again, I saw a slight difference, but nothing crazy. The biggest improvement I saw was perhaps removing the top dust filter, which I know I shouldn't do as that's not what Lian Li intended, but it did certainly help rid of my PC of more hot air so I'm glad for that. Finally, I decided to add a 10th fan into the case, serving as another exhaust to help out the top 3.

After all that, my liquid temps during gaming only reach now 43C instead of the previous 45C. That said, I'm getting told by others that is still too high of a liquid temperature to have. So now I'm at a loss, as I'm not sure what else I could do. Maybe I have some sort of ""setting"" enabled that causes AIO temperatures to rise high and everyone but me has this off... I don't know. I'm curios to hear what the liquid temp numbers are for other 5950x owners, as I'm finding it impossible to believe you could keep the temp in the 30s while gaming with a 5950x.
 
For context, the only overclocking on the CPU is RAM (to 3600) and the core voltage set to 1.1250V. I'm also on the latest BIOS, Windows and version of NZXT CAM.

Was running at 1440p with a 3900x, 16 GB of 3600 MHz RAM. After getting feedback I decided it was a CPU bottleneck, so I upgraded to the 5800x. After enabling Smart Access Memory. I am now getting 160-260 fps at 1440p, but will still get pretty consistent dips to the 130 range. After that, I decided to run everything at maxed out settings in 1440p, which is now getting me a constant 190-200 fps with peaks of around 250, and lows of around 175. 

My last post is still staying popular even after a few months, so I thought it would be easier to post an update here.

TL;DR: 3900x was bottlenecking horribly, 580px with Smart Access Memory and the highest settings possible in 1440p is getting me 190-260 fps on Warzone.

I got CoreTemp and found that it was shooting up to 100C+ within literal minutes of gaming. After upgrading from 8gb to 16gb ram, getting a decent SSD, replacing the thermal paste and getting a cooling pad and making sure I've got the latest BIOS and all drivers the temperature has dropped to about 98C if I don't limit FPS and play on medium settings, but will still peak at 100+ which seems ridiculous. I have used Ryzen Controller with mixed success, seems to be fine on less intense games like Football Manager where I could keep it limited at around 70C without any performance issues, but when I try to play a game like AC: Odyssey it absolutely **cripples** the game even if I'm only limiting the temp to about 85/90. I'm talking 20 FPS max.

&amp;#x200B;

The main issue I have is that I keep reading completely mixed comments online from people with the same laptop ranging from, ""laptops should never go above 80, it is definitely faulty"" to ""100C is fine and it is built to work at that temp"", to crazy things like ""mine was at 100C, then I re-pasted it and put it on a cooling pad and now it is running games at max settings at 60-75C!"", to everything in-between. And being someone with very little knowledge about these things it has left me totally lost. Most solutions end up pointing towards undervolting which fixes both thermals and performance to extreme levels if what I've been reading is correct, but I haven't been able to find any instructions on how to do so with my specific laptop specs.

Amd,3700X or 5800X... with a 1070TI ?,"Hello,

I have a i5-4590, 24 GB DDR3 RAM and a GTX 1070 TI. I have this CPU since 6 years (didn't intend to last that long), *Spectre* hit hard... so I want to do a partial upgrade : CPU, Motherboard, RAM.

I don't plan to buy a GPU because... 3060/80 are a myth anyway :) and too expensive for their worth. My actual card will have to last.

Still, apart some work using VMs, I do gaming. What I play is Civilization VI, Oxygen Not Included, Stellaris, Rocket League, Eve Online, this kind of thing. I RARELY play FPS but it can happen (maybe I will try Star Citizen or Cyberpunk just to see) but I am open to severe graphics compromises.

I got this at decent prices :

\- Gigabyte B550 Aorus Pro v2

\- 2x16 Go RAM from PNY @ 3200 Mhz

And I am hesitating about the CPU because... reviews doesn't really use my kind of games apart sometimes Civilization VI and Total War, and I doubt that I can rely on FPS scores alone. Stellaris/Civ VI are CPU hog in **late game**, etc. Not really something that it is tested in reviews.

Also, AM4 platform and DDR4 memory are on the end of their life, and I never spent so much on a CPU. Still, it is rumored that the 6000 series will still be on this socket and so with probably the same kind of memory.

So I wonder if I should play light and buy a 3700X as a ""transition setup"" and maybe wait for the 6000 series (or even later with a complete renew)... or play safe and go all in for the 5800X in case that I last longer than expected. Still, a 5800X with a GTX 1070 TI... it doesn't really make sense.

**Here is the story:**

I ordered an RX 6700 XT from AMD's shop on April 1st with PayPal, package was sent by Digital River and was available for pickup on April 8th.

As I wanted to cancel my order, I refused the package and the package was on its way back to Digital River. I signed a document and the delivery status shows that I refused the package.

But, after few irregularities, the package was once again available for pickup and someone collected it on April 12th (not me, was working 30km away at that time).

I just call the delivery company (Chronopost, operating in France)  today April 15th to know where was the package and then I learned that the package was not sent to Digital River but was collected by someone.

&amp;#x200B;

I started a discussion on AMD's support website and on Digital River's but none of the websites included an option to start a claim. But now it has already been 14-days after my order...

So I edited Fallout4Prefs.ini setting 2560x1440 as as my resolution but when the game boots it doesn't get downsampled and renders at 1440p outside of my display, cutting off a good chunk of it.

Amd,PSA: AMD RMA Process Is Now Much More Restrictive,"I am just posting this as a heads up that the RMA process for AMD seems to have become much more restrictive in the past year or so. I previously RMAed a CPU back in 2019 that was fried due to a faulty motherboard (burning electrical smell, afterwards only one memory channel would work with the CPU). In that case, I just submitted the serial and I believe a picture of the CPU and they offered service with no issue. 

Now, they want a copy of the original purchase invoice, and are stating that for online orders it has to be the *original order e-mail*. So, I guess if you ordered from Amazon but deleted or lost the e-mail for whatever reason, you could not get warranty service (even though you could download the invoice off the website)? Note, this isn't a problem for me, it just seems sketchy, since it can be easily used to deny warranty claims for no good reason (even when you can easily provide legitimate proof from the site it may not be ""good enough"").

Based on this, it also doesn't sound like if you buy used from eBay you have any warranty coverage at all. If you buy a new in box from eBay it's not entirely clear if that would be covered. 

In addition to that, you have to take a picture of the CPU in your motherboard socket with the serial visible, and also include in that picture a piece of paper listing your support request. This isn't a serious problem, but more just an annoyance. 

Anyway, it is what it is, but it's definitely something to keep in mind when buying your CPU, especially if buying used (or possibly even new) on eBay. I also feel it's another unfortunate example of AMD being less customer friendly than it was in the past.",False,92,0,1,0

If you see anything that seems like a mistake let me know so I can fix it, this is not a thing I do regularly. Thanks!!!!!!

I  installed my Ryzen 5800X a few weeks ago, and it seems to be running a  bit hot: it hovers between 45c and 75c, even when I'm not doing much.  Today, when I cold booted my computer, I immediately went to the bios,  and it was reading 49c already.

Checking  Ryzen master right now, the current temp is 43c, the clock speed is  853MHz, and the voltage is 1.183V. Everything is set to default, I am  not OCing anything (except my Ram, using a preset).

My  cooling system is a 212 Evo, which has worked very well for me for many  years on my 1700x, and my 4570k before that (don't quote me exactly on  the Intel CPU name, I may be off by a digit or two). The fan is set to  auto, and I regularly hear it go crazy to cool down the CPU.

I  noticed there was a problem by routinely checking temps in Corsair  Link, and I saw one temp was 75c, and sure enough, it was the CPU. It's  not doing any extra work or anything, it just runs hot.

Just wanted to post my experience with the idle temps to see if it either helps any of you or you can second it working as I'm fairly curious!

The trick I stumbled across that works and doesn't effect performance is:

1. Set windows power and sleep &gt; additional options, to balanced
2. Install Ryzen chipset software and set the power slider in windows power and sleep to best power savings.

The CPU wasn't letting itself clock down properly at idle when i had it just on balanced and if i put it on windows additional power saving it would clock down then take time to ramp back up where as the above option it jumps from 3.29GHz idle to 4.78GHz or wherever it needs to go instantly. High performance did the same as balanced and I didn't see clocks drop below 4.2ish when it was 'idling'. Don't know if it's bad for the chip but it keeps the idle temps under control :)

Amd,Performance of AMD hardware,"AMD has great products: CPUs and GPUs. A great CPU (Ryzen!) needs great RAM. Let's see why!

**I. The AMD CPU**: if Ryzen, it is great - if Bulldozer or similar (older than Ryzen), better avoid it.

Example: Ryzen 5 5600X - 5 means middle range, 5 in 5600X means 5000 series, 6 is also middle range.

1. Frequency and IPC: Multiplying them results in single core performance, very important.  
For Ryzen CPUs, both frequency and IPC were increased with each successive series.  
The first digit in the four digit model number: the higher, the better in single core performance.  
The desktop series are: Zen 1000 series, Zen+ 2000 series, Zen 2 3000 series, Zen 3 5000 series.  
The APU series are: Zen 2000 series, Zen+ 3000 series, Zen 2 4000 series, Zen 3 5000 series.
2. Number of cores and threads: Very important, especially for productivity (video editing).  
Multicore performance is single core multiplied by number of cores and 1.2x multiplier for SMT.  
Six cores (+SMT) are enough for gaming. For productivity, you need at least eight cores.  
Ryzen 5 is mainstream, Ryzen 7 is high end, while Ryzen 9 is for highly parallel workloads.  
However, do not forget the improvements in single core performance of Zen 2 and Zen 3!
3. Other important information: CPUs ending in G are APUs and they have an integrated GPU.  
Desktop CPUs not ending in G lack an iGPU and cannot be used at all without a discrete GPU.

**II. RAM for an AMD CPU**: should be dual/quad channel and high frequency (at least 3200 MHz).

1. Frequency: Unlike Intel, an AMD CPU benefits (much) more from high frequency RAM.  
The Infinity Fabric (IF) of the CPU is tied to the RAM frequency and it has a maximum speed.  
Avoid having RAM slower than 3200 MHz. Try to buy 3600 MHz RAM for Zen 2 and Zen 3 CPUs.  
However, 4000+ MHz RAM may not work without a performance penalty due to IF limit.  
If gaming without a discrete GPU, the RAM speed (dual channel!) is the most important.
2. Latency, channels and ranks: Latency comes after frequency, the next being memory ranks.  
Always fill all the channels: dual channel for regular CPUs, quad channel for Threadripper!  
Buy a kit of two sticks (dual channel) or four sticks (quad channel), RAM may be upgraded later.  
Try to aim for the best latency (especially CL). True latency is CL divided by RAM frequency.  
Dual rank RAM sticks do have a bit better performance, buy dual rank RAM if you can.

**III. The AMD GPU**: is great (if RDNA), may be unavailable (like other GPUs), bad ray tracing in games.

1. Each GPU has a graphic processor and memory, the latter being called VRM (or video RAM).  
The frequency of the processor multiplied with the number of Unified Shaders = performance.  
However, this holds only for the same GPU series: RX 400, RX 500, Vega, RX 5000, RX 6000.
2. The GPU must have enough VRAM for the game or productivity software used, that is it.  
The system RAM is much slower, that is why integrated GPUs are so weak for gaming.  
The memory bus width (ranging from 64 bit to 512 bit) is an indicator of VRAM performance.

Amd,Future build check + suggestions needed,"Hi,

So for the past few months I have been researching and reading a lot of reviews and planning for a build which I will buy the components once the the prices drops back down to their MSRP.  
I am going for a Snow or White theme build with RGB and have made a list of what I want but still welcome some input from you guys. I will be mainly using the PC for gaming.

Decided on:

1) AMD R7 5800x - Went for this as 59xxx is overkill and some games can use only 8-cores.  
2) AMD RX 6800 Vanilla - Not going for any AIB OC variant as I want to do my own OC'ing.  
3) Corsair 220T White case - A 37.3L case which is not too big and can fit an ATX and it's White.  
4) Any White RGB 3600MHz CL16 RAM - A sweet spot and takes advantage of Infinity fabric.  
5) B450 | B550 - I don't mind about running Gen3 for second M.2. SSD.  
6) White AIO - Like to keep things clean so no Air cooling.   
7) White PSU - I think anything between 650W-750W should be fine with OC'ing  
8) Any White monitor - 1440p and 144Hz. Low ms latency.  
9) Glorious Model O White - Either this or a cheap White mouse  
10) 60% Keyboard RGB - White if possible but not neccessary but must be 60% in size and RGB.  


So even though I will be using a case from Corsair but I do not want to be tied to Corsair's iCue ecosystem so therefore I will not be buying any other of their RGB specific products even if they have it in White.

AIO Options:

1) Vetroo Lurker V240 White  
2) ID-Cooling Zoomflow 240x White

RAM Options:

1) TeamGroup Xtreem ARGB 3600MHz CL16  
2) Crucial Ballistix RGB White 3600MHz CL16

Motherboard Options:

1) MSI B450 Tomahawk MAX 2 - Has 2 M.2. heatsink which is what I want. Bios flashback for Ryzen 5000. Read that this is the best B450 in existence.  
2) Gigabyte B550 Aorus Pro AC - A few review site seems to have this as the best budget for OC'ing 5800x. Has 2 M.2. heatsink like the MSI.

PSU Options:

1) Corsair RM 750x  
2) Seasonic Focus GX 750 White

Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse unsure

So one thing I forgot to mention is that even though I will be spending a lot getting a R7 and 6800 and some might argue that I should get an X570 motherboard to go with it but I feel this to be the best bang for buck performance as long as the VRM and Capacitors are good for OC'ing the 5800x and RAM.  
I am trying to keep this build as low as £2200 or lower like £2000. So yeah any input are welcome. Oh and from my understanding the PCIe 4.0 x16 mode on slot 1 is dependant on CPU and not the motherboard right? in the case of the B450 to be clear.",False,10,0,1,0

________

Ryzen 5000 APUs were released today or yesterday or whatever, and as usual the igpu performance scales with the cpu. 

For what i'd buy an APU for- a lightweight computer with decent multimedia capability, that's backwards.  If i'm buying a high-zoot apu i just want the igpu for diagnostics.  But for what i'd want an APU for- secondaryPC/HTPC/NUC application, i don't need much CPU power, but good igpu performance is valuable.  

Cpu cores as so powerful these days.  A 4c cpu with rx470 class graphics would be AMAZING, but even top-shelf integrated graphics on a budget cpu would be great.  I'd pay the premium for the igpu uplift; once i have to buy a dedicated video card the packaging/power gets inconvenient.

I can't imagine anyone is stepping up to the 5700g for that sweet extra 1 CU.

OS is RHEL 8.3, and the workload is a scientific solver that pegs all cores near 100% (according to 'top') pretty much 24/7. SMT is off, because this software is licensed per thread. This is a nominal 2.9 GHz CPU, but 'lscpu' indicates the actual speed is 3.275 GHz, and it never waivers from this value:

It's possible that even though our workload maxes out the CPU, since it's running 'easy' AVX2 instructions, the CPU isn't actually working that hard. This workload HAMMERS memory bandwidth, though; one DIMM in the upper right of that pic above hovers near 80C (I'm working on that). 

Anyway, I just wanted to dispel a common trope that 'EPYC CPUs don't all-core boost'. It turns out they can/do (24/7 even), given some combination of good cooling and running certain workloads that don't tax the CPU as much as the RAM.",False,0,0,1,0
Amd,"AMD hardware - process size, frequency and performance","Hardware is made from transistors switching at a huge number of times per second.  
The clock speed (frequency) is the number of cycles in a second, a measure of speed.

1 MHz = 1 million cycles/second, 1 GHz = 1 billion cycles/second. Practical limit = 5 GHz.  
But RAM is DDR, it transfers data twice as fast, so 3200 MHz RAM is actually 1600 MHz.

Transistors are tiny, nanometres (nm) in size. The process size is now a marketing term.  
AMD CPUs and GPUs are the most advanced (great!), being on the 7 nm TSMC process.

Smaller transistors = smaller power consumption, as well as variable performance gains.  
GPUs improve faster than CPUs, core count improves faster than single core performance.

The table below: more information about latest process sizes and various AMD hardware!

|Type of hardware|Process size|More details|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Intel CPUs|14 nm (since Broadwell - 2014)|Stuck on same process size|
|NVIDIA GPUs|Samsung 8 nm (RTX 3000)|Similar in performance to AMD|
|Zen 3 (Ryzen 5000 - 2020)|TSMC 7 nm|Better than Intel CPUs|
|Zen 2 (Ryzen 3000 - 2019)|TSMC 7 nm|First consumer 16 core CPU|
|Zen+ (Ryzen 2000 - 2018)|GloFo 12 nm|Improved RAM compatibility|
|Zen (Ryzen 1000 - 2017)|GloFo 14 nm|Ryzen! Left Intel in disbelief|
|Older AMD CPUs|32 nm or older|Avoid them! Bad performance|
|RDNA 2 (RX 6000 - 2020)|TSMC 7 nm|Performance reached NVIDIA|

|Radeon RX Vega (2017)|Samsung/GloFo 14 nm|High end (after a long time)|

|RX 400 (2016)|14 nm|Oldest still useful AMD GPUs|
|Older AMD GPUs|28 nm or older|Too old for modern gaming|

***Why is my motherboard not listed?***

If you are looking for your motherboard/model I would suggest going to https://www.asus.com/us/support/ and checking if it has been updated recently. I post updates on a weekly basis. UEFI’s are released in waves, because of this it can take an entire series weeks or months to see the “same” update if it includes items like CPU firmware. Furthermore, keep in mind that not all updates are applicable to all models. Due to inherent design differences as well as specification and feature variation an update may only be applicable to a specific model.

***How can I be notified about releases?***

If you want to be kept in the loop, you can also follow me for notifications when updates are released/posted. I am also the admin for our PCDIY Facebook Group where I post updates and other ASUS centric product news https://www.facebook.com/groups/ASUSPCDIY

***How long after a board is produced will UEFI updates be released?***

Keep in mind that generally after a year a motherboard reaches a certain maturity level and as such will see fewer updates. If you feel you have an issue that is dependent on a UEFI release, please submit a support ticket. In some cases, some boards can see updates for more than 24 months+

***I want to update but am not sure how to update the UEFI ""BIOS""?***

If you want guidance on how to flash/update your UEFI BIOS please watch the video linked below.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scK8AP8ZACc

***Should I update the UEFI if my system is stable and running without issue?***

If your system is running without issue, especially if overclocked in any way ( including DRAM ) it is advised you stay on the build/release you are on. Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can change the OC experience and require you to retune a previously stable OC value. This does not mean the UEFI is not a functioning release but that changes in the underlying code base need to be accounted for when tuning a system. As many of these values are in low level or specific operating parameters it is best to retune from full UEFI defaults after you have re-run stability test at UEFI defaults.

***What if the UEFI BIOS listed is a BETA? Should I update?***

BETA UEFI releases are for enthusiasts who want access to the latest features, functions, and microcode enhancements, and overall UEFI improvements. As they are not officially supported, they are not recommended for day-to-day / long-term use. Users who plan to use their system in this capacity and want to ensure the best interoperability/compatibility and stability, as well as performance, should wait for a formal release.

***Will a UEFI ""BIOS"" update improve the performance of my system?***

A UEFI update can include CPU microcode as well as other performance tuning adjustment enhancements for the UEFI that can influence/increase performance. With this noted it is generally minimal. As always performance analysis/comparisons should be done at stock-to-stock values. This means loading F5 on both releases and comparing your application/benchmark scores. OC-related comparisons may require retuning prior to testing as changes to underlying auto rules can invalidate prior scores even if with similar settings.

***Not every user should update/flash their UEFI BIOS. I stress this again, if you are running without issue(s) you are advised to stay on the release you are running.*** 

***Notes to consider -***

***\* When flashing please perform the update process at full UEFI defaults. Do NOT flash with an overclocked system/profile.***

1.I recommend updating the UEFI BIOS on your motherboard for new PC builds. This helps to ensure the best interoperability, compatibility, and performance. If you are building a PC and have not yet installed the OS, I would recommend you update the UEFI.

2.Keep in mind flashing/updating the UEFI will reset all defined parameters/settings and operating profiles. You will not be able to restore defined values by using a UEFI Profile as profiles are not interoperable between builds. It is advised you note or screenshot (F12) your values prior to flashing if they are complex. Upon completing a flash, I would recommend you load UEFI defaults after the fact and complete a full reboot and shutdown prior to re-entering your prior values. Keep in mind you may need to retune these values under a new UEFI.

3.When you update the UEFI and re-load UEFI defaults depending on your originally defined CSM/UEFI device parameters you may experience BOOT issues. Depending on prior settings you may need to enable or disable CSM to restore BOOT functionality.

4.Be advised that in some cases a rollback to a prior UEFI is not possible. This generally is the case when there is an update that includes CPU microcode (such as an AMD AEGSA or Intel ME). This means you may not be able to “flashback” to a prior release.

5.While not always necessary some UEFI updates may require a clearing of the CMOS. You can either clear the CMOS via the CLR CMOS button if your motherboard has this feature/function or you can also CLR CMOS by removing the onboard CMOS battery for at least a few minutes. You can also attempt to locate the CLR CMOS jumper on the motherboard and short the pins.

6.In some cases, you may not be able to jump from an older UEFI release to a much newer release. You may need to ""step"" update, this will mean upgrading incrementally to a slightly newer build first prior to going to the most recent build/release. In most situations this not required.

I also recommend you backup your system prior to any flash/update and always advise flash/update become executed from a fresh loading (F5) of UEFI defaults.

Amd,Choosing between a 5600x and 5800x,"Hey everyone! I'm planning on building a new rig in the next couple of months and was considering switching to the red team. I've currently got a 6700k  which I've had for about 5 years now. I mainly do gaming (currently 1080p but thinking of eventually going 1440p or 4k) and programming. I also don't go for higher refresh rates, I would rather have eye candy at a solid 60fps and mainly play single player. I don't do any video editing or streaming, but might within the next couple of years but it's certainly not my use case currently.

I don't upgrade often and plan on keeping this new build for at least 4 years. Right now I've seen great things about the 5600x: great gaming performance, lower price ($440), and lower thermals (I'll be building in a micro atx mini tower so I won't have as much space for a good air cooler).

On the other hand, the 5800x is a definite increase in compile performance and other productivity, increase in gaming performance, but is also $200 more and I have heard it runs way hotter than a 5600x.

For someone who will be keeping this for at least 4 years, is it worth a $200 jump in price for the 5800x? Do you think the 5600x will still be a solid gaming choice at higher resolutions for the next 4 years?",False,28,0,1,0

Amd,RMA Process Experience - 5950X,"Hello,

Just wanted a conversation on other peoples RMA experience with AMD, more so around CPUs as it's relevant to me but in general is good too! A**pologies for the wall of text it has been a living nightmare getting my 5950X replaced** (it had massive memory stability issues, constant BSOD, not just WHEA, instability over 2 motherboards with 4 different QVL memory kits even at default incredibly loose settings.)

My experience:

I live in the UK and after going through the RMA questionnaire was provided a 5 page PDF with shipping labels and 2 identical commercial invoices.  Told to 'print the 3 shipping labels' and that the courier would know what to do with them. I sent my package with these labels and the DHL place accepted it. 

I got emailed by the courier (DHL) on the same day giving me 2 hours to reply with the commercial invoice or they would return my package to me, I was working so I did not see this email. None of this is detailed in the link they eventually manually sent me with shipping instructions either, which specifically is in the context you send the package yourself and arrange shipping. 

The box had been opened for inspection by DHL and half crushed, upon opening the package to repack the box I noticed that through the CPU tray I could see a large greasy finger, possibly thumb print on the top of my CPU AND a scratch. It is still puzzling to me not only why they would open the CPU tray up but how in the hell they would scratch the lid, from the RMA process I had my immaculate CPU pictured moments before sending cleaned to perfection... annoying but hey ho, it's broken anyway and still meets the RMA criteria. I complained to DHL.. job done. 

DHL explains I need new shipping details and to send it again with the commercial invoice. As I can no longer follow up my service request as the general tickets expire while the RMA does not, I have to log new requests just go get back to my RMA (which they ask me to provide all detail for again) and request new shipping labels.. which they did not understand.. this takes near 2 weeks to get done. 

It arrived and a week later I have contacted AMD to ask the progress and have just now got confirmation it has been accepted and my replacement will be sent 'shortly' Not sure what peoples experience of time frames is like from this point onwards?

I am currently running an old i5-2500k, and I am in need for an upgrade. I plan to study Unity, Stream, Render and Cut videos, whatever u can imagine, and my current machine isn't really capable of doing it without killing my eyes with powerpoint presentation equivalent fps. Even if it's not the best time to upgrade, I have to pull the trigger now (in my country there are no CPU shortages but our VAT is over the moon and I am an eu reisdent) I am planning long term, my current warmachine lasted 8 years, the next one is going to be for at least another 5 years minimum. GPU stays, currently i have an RX580 8gb, will upgrade in 1-3 years when the prices aren't bs.

&amp;#x200B;

**CURRENCY IS CONVERTED TO USD FROM MY COUNTRY'S CURRENCY BASED ON TODAY'S RATES**

&amp;#x200B;

I have 2 builds in mind, no other ""upgrade"" path avaliable for my vallet, for example 5900x costs double of 5800x so please dont suggest that :D (yes, you heard it right, double. 1000$. no scalping, retail price)

&amp;#x200B;

**Intel**

* 10850k with either MSI Z490 gaming edge(currently out of stock) or Gigabyte Z490 Aorus Elite AC 670$ for either choice (so in this case 438$ for cpu and 232$ for either MOBO) so most likely would pull the trigger for Aorus Elite AC, prices are all time low today, been watching it for weeks, will go up again
* Gskill 3200Mhz CL16 32GB ram
* Deepcool assassin III for cooler
* Bequiet pure base 500DX
* Corsair RM750x (its dirt cheap atm compared to Seasonic Focus GX750)
* ADATA M2 SSD SX8200 PRO 1TB

&amp;#x200B;

**AMD** 

* 5800x with either MSI B550 Tomahawk  or ASUS ROG STRIX B550-A  so overall 690$ or 700$(509$ for CPU and 180$ for the tomahawk or 190$ for the asus) prices are stagnating for at least 4 weeks, there were times when price went up but 500ish is the normal price here
* Gskill 3200Mhz CL16 32GB ram
* Deepcool assassin III for cooler
* Bequiet pure base 500DX
* Corsair RM750x (its dirt cheap atm compared to Seasonic Focus GX750)
* ADATA M2 SSD SX8200 PRO 1TB

&amp;#x200B;

Could go for better ram, but then i have to cut to 16GB, ram prices aren't cute here. For example CL16 3600mhz 32GB is 120$ more than the 3200 counterpart. Can't go noctua NH-D15 cos it costs 40$ more everywhere in my country (Deepcool seems to have same performance). I don't really want watercooler, I would rather not risk possible leaks even if its 1% and kms in the process.  


Reason for Intel: 

* I didn't really read bios and random WHEA issues so Stability (at least until finetuning the 5800x, I dont really like to mess with BIOS but I will have to with AMD, It's not that I can't more like I don't like)
* Integrated GPU in case current GPU decides to go for a vacation and current GPU prices aren't even close to funny (although I have a spare old R9 270x xD)  


Reason for AMD: 

* Mainstream 
* Equal in some cases and better performance in other 
* ""Most likely more electricity bill friendly""
* PCIE4 for whatever use in the future
* And whatever I missed is in the specification itself such as cache and so on  


Downgrading parts would only mean to save some money, if you suggest that I will also take it into consideration, but most likely(I am 90% sure) I won't touch or upgrade anything in the future besides GPU, so buying a 5900x, 5950x, 10900k or 11900k or whatever won't be an option for me.

Other comparisons 5600x is 412$, 10700k is 354$, 9900k is 377$, 11th gen not worth mentioning since price is over the moon here, z590 mobos too.

Hi there! I currently have an RTX 2080 Ti and my friend is willing to sell me his RX 6900XT for MSRP at $999. I play FPS games like CS GO, Valorant, Call of duty, Warzone, Apex legends, Overwatch etc. I play on competitive low settings at 1080p to achieve higher fps and I have a 240HZ monitor. Aside from my 2080 Ti, I have an I9-10900K paired with 32 GB 3200 MHZ RAM. Is it worth upgrading from my 2080 Ti to an RX 6900 XT if i’m mainly playing at 1080p low competitive settings?

Amd,When can I stop worrying about the temp of my processor? (AMD Ryzen 3700x),"I figured this was the best place to ask this and didn't see another post addressing the issue I'm having exactly. About a month ago I purchased [this PC from Best Buy.](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/cyberpowerpc-gamer-supreme-gaming-desktop-amd-ryzen-7-3700x-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-1tb-ssd-white/6434646.p?skuId=6434646) It's the first gaming PC I've ever owned. I've been using it to play mostly Civ 6 and Warzone. When I got it, I noticed that the CPU (AMD Ryzen 3700x) was getting pretty hot. When playing Warzone it would peak in the high 80's sometimes getting as a high as 90. If you read some of the reviews on the Best Buy website, hot temps seem to be a problem due to the poor airflow from the case.

I have since put 4 fans in it; 3 along the top as exhaust fans, and one extra in the front as an intake fans in addition to replacing the factory thermal paste. Usually when I play warzone, temperatures seems to avg lower (around 60 - 70 degrees) but my max temp is still high. The CPU got up to 85 after 3 or 4 Warzone matches directly before making this post.

At this point the only thing left to do is replace the AIO it came with. My question is is that necessary? It seems like many feel that 80 degrees is way too hot. Others say the CPU won't throttle until it hits 95. I'm also not sure what I should pay attention to: avg temps or max temps.

Amd,"Simple Trick Iv been using to secure Day 1 purchases nearly an hour after each release from AMD.com (no Bots, no 3rd party software)","I have seen alot of the posts here lately have been ripping on AMD store website for the plethora of issues they have been facing. At first I was confused what the issue was exactly, as I had not run into any issue making purchases as late as 50 minutes after release (when gpus were long sold out?). It should be noted that this ""trick"" may simply be a coincidence, and that I may have been extremely (more like insanely) lucky. If this is the case, I would be even more surprised. Please note I am in Canada. The US store may behave differently.  

  

 Here are the simple steps (from memory only):  

  

1) Make sure you have a incognito tab open (i used chrome or IE) with the gpu purchasing landing page, with all the different gpus showing. Those available will have an add to cart below. Click add to cart. You will see a spinning circle. If this does not add to cart, simple keep trying, but allowing two seconds or so between each attempt.  

  

2) Once it shows as adding to your cart, right click cart, open in new incognito tab. Essentially for every stage in the buying process you will have new incognito tabs open. If anything goes awry, you have each stage ""saved"" in a way.   

  

3) Go to pay for the gpu. Whatever you do, do not use paypal! Type in your cc info. Once you hit ""ok"" , make sure the resulting page url is copied (just in case it errors out). Paste this into a new incognito tab if so.  

  

4) If it keeps erroring out, or giving blank or no response, keep selecting the url, copy into new incognito tab, then hitting enter. (It will not charge you multiple times). Eventually you will see a popup showing it went thru. The final order confirmed page url may need to be copied over into a new tab and reloaded several times to finally show. Whatever you do, do not spam refresh, wait 2 seconds each time. It will not ""go thru"" ever until it shows on screen that the order was recieved.  

  

Keep in mind you will not receive any confirmation from amd via email for several hours. Also your order number will not work in the search order number page. The only indication my order went thru at first was that the amount was charged onto my cc.

My only question is would the upgrade completely remedy all of my issues? I am mostly concerned with how much of a jump in performance it would mean for VR.

But here in Canada, the 10700K is $410 and the overpriced 5600x is $430.  Both platform have the bad intel LAN issues that are a gamble when you receive your board hoping you get a B3 revision.  

I can get a good mobo for the AMD for $200 while I need to go at \~$350 for the same type of feature here in Canada.

I currently am still running my 2600K OC on water after all these years but it's getting more and more a big bottleneck.  

Last option was getting the 11600K since it's ok in price/performance on that whole Rocket Lake lukewarm launch.  B560 boards are not in stock here as well so I imagine that they will arrive eventually.  Seems like the any new platform, there's some bugs though but at least I don't have to deal with with the Intel LAN issue since it's confirmed B560 and Z590 all have the new B3 revision.

Amd,Lian Li Lancool II Mesh Performance Fan Placement,"[Possible fan locations](https://i.imgur.com/Gis1WjY.jpg)

I’m attempting to build my first PC in the Lian Li Lancool 2 Mesh Performance and I’m trying to find the most optimal location for intake and exhaust fans for both my 3080RTX and Ryzen 9 5900X.

The case already has two 140 fans in the front for intake and one 120 in the rear for exhaust.

Specs: [https://es.pcpartpicker.com/list/BrHq2V](https://es.pcpartpicker.com/list/BrHq2V)

Should i :

1. use a 360mm AIO and put it in the front panels and then buy/use the remaining fan slots to cool down the rest of the components but then my GPU cooling system is less good

OR...

2.  use a 240mm AIO and place it on the top and use/buy the remaining slot fans to cool the rest ofthe components but the CPU cooling system is then less good but the front pannel can be usedto improve my GPU cooling

My question rises after seeing this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mMBA4lzDvo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mMBA4lzDvo) , in this video christopher uses the AIO in the front but i read somewhere that since my GPU is a 3080 and not a 2080 like his, using the AIO at this location will make the GPU temperatures too high. I'm a bit lost and would like to know from people what should i do since my ryzen 9 5900X also requires some fresh air ;)

Amd,PSA: Too high VRAM frequency can reduce fps even if it is fully stable (tested on RX 6800 XT),"Hey. Did some testing and sharing results.

**TL;DR**: Too high VRAM frequency CAN SOMETIMES reduce fps. It might be stable and not crashing but there will be performance penalty. If you set surprisingly high mem frequency and it works, toggle it between stock and your target frequency few times and compare in few games if you get reduced fps. Might only apply to Radeon 6000 cards, tested in my case with 6800 XT.

---

First thing first, don't be like me and play with your hardware for WEEKS to debug why you get stutters, grab any USB and install Windows-To-Go on it to check if you still get them on fresh Windows installation so you don't waste time juggling your hardware.

Because of above I tried literally every single thing with my PC and found out that too high memory can reduce fps. It CAN reduce it but sometimes it will not. It depends.

In Cyberpunk my RX 6800 XT will get 4-8 fps less on 2150 MHz VRAM than stock 2000 MHz. It will lose fps every 9 out of 10 tries when I reset to default and set 2150 MHz again. It seems to ""stabilize"" at around 2130-2140 MHz so I set 2124 MHz just in case.

Some other games like Ghostrunner or Borderlands 3 work a bit differently. Ghostrunner will gain fps all the way to 2150 MHz... but not always! The fps will be reduced when I revert to default and set 2150 MHz over and over until finally after 5th or 15th try the fps is reduced. In Borderlands 3 setting 2150 MHz will give very slightly less fps than 2124 MHz and stock settings. In Cyberpunk and Ghostrunner cases the total power used will drop by 5-10W.

As to why it happens. Who knows. From googling for a bit it seems to be probably error correction or some shit. The setting seems to be stable. Yes, the games won't crash, drivers won't reset. But there is the performance penalty. It could be throttling to not crash as well - as indicated by the reduction in total GPU power usage. The memory was not reaching throttling temps and stays in line with core temp (AsRock Taichi seems to be solid with lots of thermal pads, all temp sensors stay within each other by around 5-10C). Everytime I apply new memory frequency, the monitor will blink for split second indicating that it reloaded memory configuration or something. I think at that time the performance penalty applies. Could be also applied later on-the-fly when errors are detected by GPU but didn't test this case.

I'm listing some comparison screenshots below (the sensor show 12 MHz less than set in Radeon Settings). All settings were the same and untouched except memory frequency. The settings were toggled between 2000 MHz and 2150 MHz until good or bad result was produced.

Initially thought server-grade hardware in order to get everything in a single box, but I don't need ECC ram, server CPU frequencies are lower, and price per performance is higher.

I will be running these machines headlessly, so only graphics needed would be terminal and initial OS installation.

At 30 GB per core, the 256GB RAM would give me space for 8 physical cores, so maybe would want 12 physical cores at least. Don't need to waste good money on extra cores that I won't need.

So here's the build. Would be able to get 3 of these.

Amd,Big amd fan but i have a small rant.,"So ive finally finished my pc build, haven't build a rig in like 10 and i went all amd because thats how my previous one was and i loved it. Ive heard rants and stories about how the driver updates are trash for a long time now and ive mostly ignored them but ive ran into and issue that i cant avoid recently and its killing me. Small bit if extra context first: i have a 5600x and a xfx 6800xt all of which are up to date except my gpu.
Let me explain:

My favorite game that i play is final fantasy 14 (the mmo) and when i first got my card it ran amazingly. I can finally play on maxed out setting in 4k and manage like 70-80 fps which is perfect because my monitor is only 60hz so i stay max out on it constantly. And its was sweet sweet nectar of the gods for like 2 weeks. This diver update comes out and i install it, but when i get back in my game its only running at 11fps. This is not ok and im freaking out like ""oh crap it i fudge a setting? Is my hardware damaged?"" Anything and everything i can think of untill i finally decide to roll back my driver. Back up to 80fps. Ok so i wait for the next update because the last one was an optional update. The next one that comes out is a ""recommend"" up date so i install it and it drops me to 20fps... Once again i roll back but this time theres a catch... I start green screen crashing randomly. I watching my temps, which are fine, and hardware monitoring the hell out my rig to see if there is anything i can do but alas it seems to be driver related. 

Now as far as i can tell this is the only game i have that is effected by this and the rest of them are fine if not better. Im just frustrated that its my main game and the green screens are driving me crazy. I get the driver thing now..

Amd,What are the ideal settings in Ryzen Master? (I’m a noob),"So I’m still in the early process of setting up my pc regarding fans curves and also cpu speed.

However I’m a bit cautious over messing with the settings. I’m avoiding putting my 3900xt above 4ghz, as it sends the fans into full speed for some reason. I currently have the cpu locked at 3,900 MHz in manual and the voltage at like 1.1/1.2 (which someone told me was “crippling” the cpu as he put it)

I don’t want to push the cpu to its limit but I’m wondering what an ideal setting would be for gaming, for creativity, or maybe a general balanced setting that acts as an all rounder

This is my first pc and I’m obviously terrified of breaking anything and until I figure out the correct fan curve I need in bios I don’t feel comfortable doing much of anything.

Amd,So I Managed to Swap a 5700XT for a 6700XT for Free...,"Heya fellow AMD enthusiasts!

I’ve been a long-time lurker of the sub and an adopter of team red since the very first Ryzen with a Ryzen 1700 and RX480 4GB. I built this current setup last year with a 3800X (got a good deal on it from Amazon) and originally a Sapphire Pulse 5700XT. I had modded the Pulse by plastidipping it white and switching out the red “SAPPHIRE” LED to the blue one you see in the pic.

Intro aside, due to the recent mining craze, I saw posts in some Facebook groups where people had managed to swap their 5700XT for a 6700XT (this due to the superior hashrate on the 5700XT). Some were able to do it for free, others had to pay a small difference. I decided to try my luck and listed my card for a swap, or otherwise a sale/buy price of $25,000 TWD (approx. $879 USD). I had my sights set on a Sapphire Nitro+ 6700XT, since most of the other models out there were going for about 10-20% cheaper. Within a day of the listing, several people contacted me, willing to purchase the card for the listed price. Though nobody had the Nitro+ 6700XT on hand to trade, one of the people who reached out to me wanted to sell me the card for the listed price. Long story short, I managed to buy the Nitro+ first, then sell off my Pulse immediately after, essentially getting a free upgrade.

Though the modified Pulse 5700XT has a lot of sentimental value to me, frankly I could not resist the free upgrade. Up to 35% performance uplift in games depending on the resolution you play on, unlocking SAM, 4GB more VRAM (must…always…have…MOAR!!!), Infinity Cache, refreshed card warranty and resale value, and of course ARGB support, just to mention a couple of points. I do feel a bit of a sting when I think of the fate that awaits my Pulse 5700XT (off to the mines you go, kid), but in the end, it was worth it, I guess? What would y’all have done, would you have taken the same trade?

Hope this post provides some insight into the current meta (will vary from region to region), and helps anyone else who is thinking about snatching a free(ish) upgrade while it lasts!

Love you all, stay safe out there everyone &lt;3

Not everyone overclock, so it doesn't make any sense for everyone to spend $262 on the Core i5-11600K.

Going back to AMD: if AMD releases Ryzen 5 5400, a hypothetical Ryzen 5 5600X, but with locked multiplier, lower clocks, etc., what is wrong with that?

That would be a great product for many people who don't overclock and would rather have a discount.

Amd,Did AMD (RMA via ModusLink) just replace my Ryzen 7 PRO 4750G with a Ryzen 7 3600X (without an iGPU)?,"Hi all,

I sent in my 4750G APU for RMA replacement last week to the ModusLink facility in FL, USA, and just this morning got 2 emails that the AMD RMA had shipped.

The first one included this in the body:
""RMA# [REDACTED], OPN 100-100000145MPK, Serial number""

Whereas the second one, sent 15 minutes later, had this instead: ""RMA# [REDACTED], OPN 100-100000071BOX, Serial number""

Looking at the OPN codes, the first one is the code for a 4750G APU, which is what I sent in. But then they sent that second email a few minutes later with the OPN code of a 3700X. Does this mean they sent me an ""equivalent"" (only in terms of core/thread count and clock speed) CPU, but yet I will be missing the iGPU which was required for my setup on the computer I'm using...


It looks like something similar happened to another user on here, where /u/AMD_Gary was able to help out: https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/i93iam/rma_replacement_was_a_different_product/

Amd,Unhappy with AMD handling my issue with a faulty 5900X that was causing WHEA-Logger Event ID 18,"My 5900X was causing “Event 18, WHEA-Logger” error on Windows 10 which was giving blue screen of death and reseting the PC.  I have found posts in the web that a lot of people with Ryzen CPUs report similar problem and relate it to boosting/voltage problem of some defected cores at stock settings.  My issue was almost exactly the same with the one posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/k25etz/5900x_whealogger_event_id_18_cache_hierarchy_error/). The reason I am writing a new post is that I am very disappointed with how AMD handled my issue and wanted to raise an awareness of the issue since I believe the issue is very common and should be officially acknowledged by AMD.

**Issue**

Processor APICs 0, 8, 10 and 11 were causing “Event 18, WHEA-Logger” error with 2 different error types: ""Cache Hierarchy Error"" and ""Bus/Interconnect Error "". I wasn't getting the error with full single-core load or full multi-core load so benchmarks were not helpful for reproducing. I was getting the error while gaming sometimes in 30 mins, sometimes in more than 1 hour. For troubleshooting, I tried many things which didn't solve the issue (different BIOS versions with default settings, disabled/enabled XMP profile, updated/reinstalled all the drivers, clean format, reinstalled the CPU, different versions of chipset drivers, different VBIOS versions, different GPU drivers, etc...).

**How AMD handled my issue?**

I sent the CPU for warranty and it is confirmed that the CPU was faulty. The thing is although I insisted on a replacement, I got a refund. When I was informed that I will get a refund, I contacted the seller, the authorized service and the main distributer in my region, all of which declined my request for replacement, saying 5900X is out of stock and they have to follow a procedure. Then, I contacted AMD itself asking for help. AMD responded that if I have the faulty CPU with me, they can send a replacement but I would have to pay the customs duty for import clearance. Although that meant I need to pay at least 18% extra of what I already paid, I was OK with it because I didn't want to indefinitely wait for a new stock and pay much more (the currency of my country depreciated a lot in the meantime). However,  the seller, the authorized service and the main distributer again refused my request when I asked them to return my faulty CPU, saying they have to follow a procedure... I replied to AMD explaining the situation but their response was the same: they can offer the replacement if I have the CPU. 

At the end, I got the refund and bought a 5950X by paying a premium (because 5900X was out of stock). I have to admit that 5950X is just great (and I haven't got an error in 4 weeks) but paying that premium and getting extra 4 cores was not necessary for me.",False,9,0,1,0

- Good open source driver support
- good support for lots of programs that support GPU acceleration/computing in general
- 16 GiB vRAM
- Reliable (won't fail or catch on fire, will last a long time, etc.)
- Fairly stable and efficient power usage/wattage (won't cost a fortune to run, even when I'm doing something GPU-intensive)
- No fancy lights (e.g. RGB lighting for epic gamerz)
- Can play Minecraft with fancy shading effects (e.g. SEUS on high settings), as well as other games with medium to high graphics settings, at a mostly smooth 60 fps
- Decent for editing video in DaVinci Resolve at 1440p 60 fps or 4k 30 fps, possibly even 4k 60fps
- Decent for doing motion graphics (including generative motion graphics such as with Processing) at the frame rates and resolutions mentioned above, except if it's real-time, which would be more like 1080p60
- 3D rendering in Blender with Cycles at above frame rates and resolutions in a semi-bearable amount of time in proportion to the total length of whatever I'm making
- Okay support for GPU-accelerated Deep/Machine learning, largely for artistic purposes (e.g. generating human faces that don't exist, blending together sounds, etc.). I know that Nvidia cards which support CUDA are generally better for this application, but I want use a computing system that's more open, even if it means jumping through a few extra hoops and losing some performance over an equivalent Nvidia card to do anything I'd want to do regarding this kind of stuff
- Decent hashrate just in case I ever get into crypto-mining one day
- Price is significantly better compared to other high-end/professional cards. I don't have a specific budget yet, but I don't to spend over 2 grand, and preferrably quite a bit less than that, like under $1250

Amd,Choosing between i5 11400f or 5600x?,"Hey guys, I'm very close to completing my build, need a motherboard and cpu.

I will be pairing it with a 6700XT. I have a hard time making my mind between getting the 11400f or the 5600x. The i5 11400f I can buy it for $190 in my country, it is close/equal to US msrp.

For the 5600x unfortunately, I could get it for $380 (in stock) from a local retailer, or wait a bit and buy it from the US and ship it here with import duties and tax it would end up being around $350 - I had a hard time actually finding it in stock from the US though, so I could be waiting a while... Buying from a local shop would still be my best bet, as I would get 1 year warranty, for a $30 difference.

Now regarding the choice, budget wise, I have the money to spend on the 5600x. But I would still rather have a better deal at the end of the day and save the money, although that money will not be used to improve my build, as I already bought all the parts for my build excluding cpu and mobo.

The difference in price is a bit high, as you can see. I will be playing on a 1440p144hz monitor exclusively. I (nowadays, rarely) play the occasional competitive game like cs/valorant/dota, but these titles are obviously not my main focus for my purchasing decision, although these games apparently have seen a noticeable improvement from benchmarks with the 5600x (example, I play csgo at 1080p, as thats what I'm used to) but for most if not all of my games I would be playing at 1440p.

I have found a couple of benchmarks on youtube with the 5600x and 11400f tested in different benchmarks originating from different yt channels and the results differed strangely. For instance, from one video from a less reputable uploader, he benchmarked both cpus with the 3070, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYvh8pa8NiQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYvh8pa8NiQ) most results indicated similar, or even better performance for the 11400f which is quite strange. I am not sure whether I should take these results for granted. Gamer Nexus, a reputable youtuber had some more logical/expected results with the 5600x edging quite significantly at 1080p, but with smaller gains at 1440p over the 11400f. Unfortunately he did very few 1440p benchmarks which was what I was interested in.

Now I have seen the hardware unboxed video with the ryzen 3600, an older cpu comparable to the 10400f benchmarked with the 5600x, 5800x, 5900x etc

The results indicated that there was a small difference at 1440p, but that the difference was not really significant enough to warrant an upgrade. But for me since im building from scratch...

Another thing I would like to consider is that I would like to keep the cpu for a while, hopefully 3-5 years or so. Additionally, down the line, I will probably update my gpu in the next cycle or the cycle after this one. It will depend on the price and availability of course...

So with that in mind perhaps the 5600x would be a better choice for perhaps a bit of future proofing? I have no clue if the 11400f will be sufficient for the upcoming cards, and upcoming games, obviously time will tell and this is not something we can predict, but maybe its worth thinking about.

I tried using both ClockTuner Ryzend and Ryzen Master, but I'm a little confused about a number of things. First off, everything I've read online says that to be safe, one shouldn't go higher than 1.25V. Just from random testing, I've gotten my CPU stable to 4350Mhz at 1.35V, which from what I've been reading online, isn't stellar. However, both Ryzen Master and my BIOS seem to have my CPU set up at 1.43125v by default, which seems unusually high. In fact, CTR won't even let me set that as a reference voltage without giving me an error about it being an ""unsafe voltage."" Running CB20 with both AMD's ""Gamer Profile"" with Auto OC and PBO and my 4.35Ghz/1.35V setup, I'm showing that my performance with my settings was about 6% higher than AMD's profile, while also seemingly having a significantly lower voltage.

So I guess one of the many questions I have is, is my CPU actually running at 1.43V by default, and are my settings actually better than AMD's? And if 1.43V is perfectly fine according to AMD, would I be able to leave the voltage at 1.43V and see how close I can get to 4.8Ghz?

Amd,VP9 hardware decoding in Edge Chromium for A12-9720P,"
Hi ! 

I’ve got a laptop with the A12-9720P processor and I’m wondering if anyone else is not getting vp9 hardware decode support on their machine. I just updated Edge Chromium and Radeon drivers to their latest versions if that is relevant.

I didn’t think to notice it before (it may have been missing from the start) but now if I type in edge://gpu in the search bar and then scroll down to “Video Acceleration Information”, none of the options list VP9 anymore. On my other computers they list decode for both profile0 and profile2. 

I know that this is an older APU but WikiPedia and other outlets list it as sporting GCN 1.2 (or 2.0 based on where you’re looking), which is supposed to have native VP9 decoding. So I’m just confused here. I wonder if it’s just a bug that was introduced with the latest versions of Edge or the Radeon drivers or if it’s a hardware restriction. I’ve got the latest Radeon drivers and latest Edge on my other computer that has a Renoir APU and it lists VP9 decode just fine in the list. 

I’ve also got all the media extensions installed from the MS store (HEVC, HEIF, AV1,MPEG-2 and crucially VP9 as well). VP9 videos play just fine on YouTube but I can’t see any indication of them being hardware-accelerated and I’d love for them to be so. Would love some input and feedback on this please. Thank you ! 

P.S I uninstalled VP9 Video Extensions and reinstalled it and it didn’t fix the issue.",False,11,0,1,0

Finally after 1 week my 5950x arrived in the mail, I am a terrible builder but I spent all night building my Dream PC. Finally when I was time to boot it up, it was glorious, But then, tragedy happened. After 1 minute in windows, I got a blue screen. It kept saying Whea error or windows couldnt boot properly.  I did the typical debugging steps. Trying 1 ram stick at a time, and trying old ram that I knew worked, still got blue screens, then I checked that my cooler was seated correctly, I made sure I used thermal paste and all that. I made sure my power was plugged in correctly. I couldn't really test to see if my GPU was the problem or not but I had a strong feeling it wasn't my gpu. The next day I had a friend bring over his old 3600, well, his 3600 worked. I found out I had a DOA 5950x.  I was DEVASTATED, mainly because was soooo close ! My dream pc was pretty much ready to go ! But even worse, I had to package up the dead 5950x and ship it back to the seller, wait for the seller to receive it and then send me my full refund back. The process almost took 3 weeks. I got super lucky and found a different seller on amazon who was selling the 5950X for almost the same exact price as my refund and I bought it ! Took just 4 days to arrive this time and now I was so scared but excited ! Well, I think the waiting paid off ! I think I got super super lucky and got an Amazing Sample CPU !! Like boarder line think it's a Platinum Sample ! It takes a -30 curve optimizer and has multiple cores hit 5.1ghz. my 1st core even hit 5.175ghz ! I've just been blown away by the CPU !

So to anyone reading this !  If something bad happens and you weren't able to get your pc part that you wanted ! Just Trust the Process ! There may be a reason why you didn't get it !

Amd,Turning Tides and Repeating Patterns - AMD versus Intel,"TL;DR: The $184 i5 11400 is a seriously good value against the $210 R5 3600 and the \~$300 R5 5600X. It also has an iGPU. AMD needs to watch their low-end and mid-range CPUs, because Intel is indisputably stepping up their value game.

It's been a few months since AMD has launched their Zen 3 CPUs, bringing better levels of performance against Intel in almost all workloads, while also leading in power efficiency. Intel's numerous CPU security fiascos certainly did not do their reputation much good either. 

AMD establishing themselves as a market leader also gave them the ability to give their goods premium pricing, with very few promotions and low availability due to certain market factors. 

The pricing of Zen 3 CPUs has been a major topic of discussion and contention for people, myself included. Any company has the right to price their products as they wish, but with such action comes certain risks, especially in the value department. 

Having bought a Ryzen 5 3600 for $160, even closest available upgrade, the Ryzen 5 5600X, is priced at $299, if it can be found in stock at that price. AMD's strategy in the past with Zen 1 and Zen 2 was delivering superior value for the performance while often losing in the high-end, but it's very clear they have now shifted to a premium-pricing strategy with Zen 3.  

With the new launch of Intel's Rocket Lake processors came controversy over the value of the i9 11900K and i9 11700K, but there were highlights. A major highlight was the i5 11400. It can be found for $184 and beats out the R5 3600 ($210) very easily.  

It's as fast as the R5 5600X in certain (but few) workloads, but overall inferior, also due to being locked for overclocking. However, the i5 11400 also does have an iGPU that would allow light gaming and light graphics workloads.

Regardless of the circumstances, patterns are repeating. Just as AMD once captured the value market but failed to capture the high-end CPU market, Intel seems on track to do the same. AMD should be very cautious watching the low-end and mid-range going forward because Intel is beginning to provide an indisputable value. 

As for Intel's GPUs, it's too early for me to say anything about them, but I hope they will increase supply and even partially restore the decimated low-end, value GPU market.",False,94,0,1,0

Amd,Underclocked 5600x still idling at 45-50,"So I got myself a 5600x, stock wraith stealth cooler cooler with a nr200, two fans blowing towards the cooler from the side panel and another two for outtake on top.   
I thought the stock cooler would be enough since this is a 65W cpu, but it was idling in the high 40s. Since I don't really need that powerful of a cpu before I finally upgrade my gpu, I deceided to underclock to   
 3500MHz and undervolt to 1.05 Volt. The system is extremely stable, and real life performance is identical.   
Indeed under load (cpu-z stress test, 20 minutes) it goes up to 66 degrees C, and takes it less than a minute to drop about 17 degrees when the test is over, but the idles remain weirdly high.   
I took great care in installing the cooler, the temperatures are averaged between 3 different programs  


My guess is that undervolting affects the maximum allowed voltage and does little for the average power consumption, and I am new to all this so I don't know how to temper with that or if I should at all, but still    
I just don't understand how it can be so hot when doing nothing while hitting pretty good temperatures at 100% load, and I don't know If I should go and spend 50 euros on a good cooler, or if its life expectancy won't be affected at all by running under 50 degrees hot at all times.",False,1,0,1,0

Amd,Memory DDR4 rank vs latency in mobile/laptop scenario questions,"after reading up on articles  and posts on ryzen memory ranks, latency, speed, timings, i found  out that most, if not all are desktop scenario. In  laptop/mobile scenario, more often than not, the bios options are  extremely limited,  there are no XMP/DOCP  tweaks, so running,say, DDR4 3200mhz JEDEC, the latency will be higher than desktop. In mobile/laptop scenario, there are only max 2 ram slots too.

there are a few terminologies and meanings that i learned after reading, please inform  if this is correct :

\-bank groups(BG) : 2BG is one-sided ram , 4BG is dual-sided ram

\-rank :  single rank = 1 row of chips on 1 side of  ram ; dual rank = 2 rows of chips on 1 side of ram

&amp;#x200B;

  this brings me to my main question on these ram at JEDEC spec, based on their listed datasheets :

\-16gb HyperX DDR4 3200 CL20-22-22 single-rank, dual-sided (HX432S20IB2/16)

\-16gb Kingston ValueRam DDR4 3200 CL22-22-22 dual-rank, dual-sided (KVR32S22D8\_16)

which one will perform better, single-rank-lower-latency  or dual-rank-higher latency ?

And voltage reported during use is even lower, 1.09 is max value it rarely ever hits, it usually hovers between 0.9V and 1.03V, even during stress tests. Which seems a bit weird, isn't stock 6900xt supposed to use 1.175V? Manually tuning the voltage changes nothing. I even OCed it a little 2100mhz on memory and 2500mhz on core with +15% power and voltage still hovered around 0.9-1.03V during benchmarking and game testing.

So I'm assuming voltage readings are wrong and something may be wrong with voltage sensor on the card? I also checked that I'm not using power saver mode or ichill or any settings like that and benchmark scores are perfectly average. 


Is there a way to get proper voltage readings? Because I wanted to undervolt a card but now I'm not sure how to do that since I have no idea what is my current voltage and if moving voltage slider even does anything.

The only issue is that disabling it doesn't prevent the stuttering, only uninstalling does, and every time I uninstall it from device manager, it just keeps coming back every bootup. I even changed the setting in Windows for drivers to not automatically update and yet it still keeps doing so. Additionally, if I ever did want to use the audio port on my monitor (for example, switching between headphone and earbuds), then I can't do this, so ideally I would like to try to figure out why this driver is causing issues.

Amd,"R5 5600x frequency peak at 6600mhz, is that safe / normal?","Hi,

I make many timespy bench to find my best OC settings, at one time i don't know why at the end of test GPU Memory and CPU made a very high peak

R5 5600x at 6646.38Mhz (normaly around 4750)

RX 6800 at 2999.15 Memory clock (normaly around 2100)

We can see a bump in temperature too, PC still work and i can see the result : [https://www.3dmark.com/3dm/60367903](https://www.3dmark.com/3dm/60367903)

Almost normal result, i'm always around 14 400 [https://www.3dmark.com/3dm/60370698](https://www.3dmark.com/3dm/60370698)

And i cant reproduce this after 10 more test

My settings are PBO Enabled / Max +100Mhz / Curve -12 all core / Offset -0.0250

Stable after many OCCT / TimeSpy and other test

&amp;#x200B;

My question is what happen?

And is it safe? (maybe i already got this type of peak without monitoring)

&amp;#x200B;

Ty if you can help me.

Amd,AMD relive not recoding sound,"Hello everyone,

is there anyone who has relive actually working? I have had 2 PCs and 2 AMD Graphicscards since the introduction of the relive feature and it has never worked for me. For some reason Relive just wont work with any audio driver expect its own hdmi ones and the deafault windows driver. Altough its possible to use realtek soundcard with only the windows driver you will miss a few features. But trying to use an asus or creative soundcard internal or external will for example not work as the oem drivers are needed. While trying to fix the problem i have come across many posts of other people over the years and its 2021 now, problem still not fixed. You can search google for: amdrsserv.exe crashing, amd relive no sound realtek audio, amd relive no sound asus and many more. 

I think its quite strange as the [plays.tv](https://plays.tv) app that was shipped with amd drivers before relive never had these problems. What are your expierences or are there any solutions i might have missed?

I need a new pc, and im not quite good in terms of pc building, i have the option to go for an AMD Ryzen 5 1600 or an I5-9600KF, which shall i choose? the other system parts are: AMD RX560 4gb,16gb ram, 1TB HDD,500gb SSD.

Im asking for which one would be better in terms of performance, i do know for a fact that AMDs are better over Intel, however that mostly applies to newer cpus which the Ryzen 1600 is form 2017.

Amd,Should I upgrade ram for 5900x,"Hey guys, building a new system. Will be used for development and multi vm use as well as 1440p UW gaming. I am curious on what ram would be the best price/performance for my situation.

My build will have 

x570 aorus master
5900x
6900xt
32gb(2x16 dual rank) 3200 cl16 Samsung b-die, which I already own


Would I notice a difference moving to 3600 or 3800 speed ram, possibly cl14? I kinda feel like since I'm already going all out, it would make sense in that regard. But would i actually get a noticeable performance increase?

**However 20.4.2 drivers DOUBLES DayZ FPS and stabilizing GPU USAGE to 99% as it should be.**

I made a post few days ago about this problem on r/dayz: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/mjvz5n/rx\_5700\_dayz\_low\_fps\_stuttering\_freezing\_low\_gpu/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/mjvz5n/rx_5700_dayz_low_fps_stuttering_freezing_low_gpu/). After installing 20.4.2 drivers i can finally play DayZ almost without stuttering.

If you google about this problem you can find tons of post about it.

I recorded a video to prove that 20.4.2 was the last good drivers to play DayZ: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFfOu5KVhKM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFfOu5KVhKM).

Amd,Serious Performance Issues in Gaming - HELP,"Hi guys - desperately need some help with this as I can't workout what is wrong with my PC. I'm getting seriously bad performance in COD Warzone and other games...

**SPECS:** 

Ryzen 7 2700x / XFX GTS RX580 8gb / 16gb 3200mhz ram / MSI B450 tomahawk max mb / 1tb NVME

**Issue:** 

I get serious frame drops, down to as little as 58fps... a week ago it was running at 75fps with my Free-sync monitor. 

I recently installed an AIO and have correctly seated the cooler on CPU. My GPU is running 21.2.3 drivers, and I have recently done a fresh install of W10 to a WD blue Nvme drive. Games are installed to SATA SSD

**What am I doing wrong?** I have increased the power limit to 50% in Ryzen center, and have tried all possible solutions yet I get insane FPS drops and stuttering.. 

I know it's not the most powerful system, but it's not low end either so I'm slightly confused as to why I get such poor performance

Amd,Ram for my Ryzen 9 5900X,"Hello folks,

So I’m building a 2700 euros pc, and I just need to buy some good ram for my ryzen 9 5900x. I’m looking for a high-end ram ( 16gb ) and with a good combo between CAS and MHz ( I found a sweet deal with a ram that has 3600mhz and C16 dual for 171€ ). I’m writing this post to ask you guys if you have any other ram that could compete but with an even lower price.

Also is there a massive difference between 3600mhz C14 and C16? Worth my money?

Again, I’m thanking all of you for your time and the help and would like to remind you that I’m looking for a high-end ram under 170 euros.
